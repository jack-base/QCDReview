Recently, this issue has been addressed in the con-text of the construction of an EFT for hydrodynamics[2101–2104]. Going from aT = 0 EFT to an EFT liv-ing in the SK contour implies a doubling of degreesof freedom, but this is compensated by the fact thatadditional symmetries must be fulfilled. There are twosymmetries that have been largely discussed:– The SK symmetry. This symmetry must be fulfilledby any system, in or far from thermal equilibrium.
It implies that thelargest time equation [2124] mustbe fulfilled. This means that the difference of twoGreen’s functions that only differ in the SK sub-index of the field evaluated at the latest time mustbe zero. It is obvious that this must be the casebecause the trace of a commutator is zero. For ex-ample, in the case of a two-point Green’s function⟨φ1(t)φ1(0)⟩−⟨φ2(t)φ1(0)⟩= Tr([φ(t),φ(0)ρ]) = 0 .
(6.6.7)One consequence of this symmetry is that in thelimit of exactly classical fields (φ1 = φ2) the actionof the EFT must be zero [2101].
– The KMS symmetry. This is a symmetry that mustbefulfilledbysysteminthermalequilibrium.Awell-knownconsequenceofthissymmetryisthefluctuation-dissipation theorem. It is akin to anearliest timeequation in which, iftis the earliest time, a Green’sfunction in which the operator that appears just atthe right of the density matrix is evaluated at timet−i/T is equal to another Green’s function thatis equal except that the operator appears now justat the right of the density matrix and evaluated attime t. For the case of a two-point Green’s function⟨φ1(t2)φ1(t)⟩−⟨φ1(t2)φ2 (t−i/T)⟩=Tr (φ(t2) (φ(t)ρ−ρφ(t−i/T))) = 0 . (6.6.8)Note that the previous equation is only valid ifρ=e−H/T.
At tree level it is relatively easy to write an EFT thatfulfills these conditions. However, it is more difficultto ensure them when higher-order quantum loops areinvolved. A solution to this is to expand the theory byintroducing ghost fields and using the BRST formalism.
We note that, apart from the theoretical importanceas an example of an EFT in which medium degrees offreedom are integrated out, hydrodynamics is also veryimportant in the field of heavy ion collisions. Amongother important predictions, it describes the evolutionof the soft medium in which the hard probes discussedin this subsection evolve [2094–2096].
7 QCD under extreme conditionsConveners:Eberhard Klempt and Johanna StachelIn nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic ener-gies a new kind of matter is created, the Quark-GluonPlasma. Peter Braun-Munzinger, Anar Rustamov andJohannaStachelreportonthephasediagramofhadronicmatter at high temperature and low net baryon den-sity. A connection is made between the experimentallydetermined chemical freeze-out points and the pseudo-critical temperature for the chiral cross over transitioncomputed in lattice QCD. The role of fluctuations giv-ingexperimentalaccesstothenatureofthechiralphasetransition will be summarized. Azimuthal anisotropiesof hadron distributions show that the Quark-GluonPlasma formed in high energy collisions is strongly cou-pled, allowing to deduce bulk and shear viscosities. Inthe hot and dense plasma partons lose a large fractionof their energy and this observation leads to the deter-mination of another medium parameter, a jet transportcoefficient. Quarkonia and their role as a probe of de-confinement form the final topic of their contribution.
The phase structure of strongly interacting matter alow temperature and high density is discussed by KenjiFukushima. In this region of the phase diagram that isprobed e.g. in neutron stars, different phases and phasetransitions are expected on theoretical grounds. Astro-physical observations and the observation of gravita-tional waves lead to important constraints for calcula-tionsmodelingthetransitionsintoaquarkyonicregime,into quark matter or color-superconducting states. Thetheoretical challenges to locate a conjectured criticalend point in the QCD phase diagram are discussed.
7.1 QGPPeter Braun-Munzinger, Anar Rustamovand Johanna StachelThe infrared slavery and asymptotic freedom propertiesof QCD, discussed in previous sections, form the the-oretical basis that strongly interacting matter at finite242 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONStemperature and/or density exists in different thermo-dynamic phases. This was realized [427, 428] alreadyshortly after these properties of QCD were introduced.
The term quark-gluon plasma (QGP) was coined soonafter by Shuryak [1353] for the high temperature/den-sity phase where confinement is lifted and a global sym-metry of QCD, the chiral symmetry, is restored. Thefirst lattice QCD (lQCD) calculations of the equationof state were performed soon thereafter [434]. Alreadyin early lQCD calculations a close link between de-confinement and restoration of chiral symmetry wasfound [426].
For deconfinement there is an order parameter forthe phase transition, the so-called Polyakov loop, in thelimit without dynamical quarks. For chiral symmetryrestoration the chiral condensate⟨¯ψψ⟩forms an orderparameterforvanishingbutalsoforfinitequarkmasses.
Indeed, recent numerical lQCD calculations [442] pro-vide, in the limit of massless u and d quarks, strongindications for a genuine second-order chiral transitionbetween a hadron gas and a QGP at a critical tem-perature of Tc ≈132+3−6 MeV. For realistic u,d,s-quarkmasses, chiral symmetry is restored in a crossover tran-sition at vanishing net-baryon density and a preciselydetermined pseudo-critical temperature ofTpc = 156.5±1.5 MeV [ 448]. Consistent with this result, a tran-sition temperature of 158.0 ±0.6 MeV was recentlyreported in [451]. This pseudo-critical temperature isfound as a maximum in the susceptibility (derivativewith respect to mass) of the chiral condensate as dis-played in Fig7.1.1. Contrary to early ideas, the systemremains strongly coupled over a rather large tempera-ture range aboveTpc. This is reflected in the interac-tion measure computed in lQCD as the difference be-tween the energy density and three times the pressure,I = ϵ−3P, which by definition vanishes for an ideal gasofmasslessquarksandgluons.Fig. 7.1.2showsthatthisinteraction measure, normalized to the fourth power ofthe temperature, peaks at about 20% aboveTpc andfalls off only slowly towards higher temperature values.
The lQCD calculations have been extended into theregionoffinitenetbaryondensityquantifiedbyabaryonchemical potentialµB [448, 451]. Current lQCD expan-sion techniques are valid in the regime ofµB/T ≤3.
The so obtained line of pseudo-critical temperatures isshown in the QCD phase diagram displayed in Fig7.1.9below. Because of the sign problem, the lQCD tech-nique cannot be applied for still larger values ofµB,see e.g. [2125], and one has to resort to models of QCDfor theoretical guidance in the high net baryon densityregion.

The fermionic operators were calculated using the stan-dard stochastic estimator technique; more details aboutthese computations can be found in Ref. [10].
As discussed in Sec. 2.3, determinations ofTc(0), κX2and κX4 involve computing derivatives of the basic chiralobservables and their Taylor coeﬃcients with respect tothe temperature. To compute these derivatives, we in-terpolated the basic observables inT between the com-puted data via the following procedure. For each observ-able several [m,n ] Pad´ e approximants were used forN(> m+ n) computed data, andN was varied by leavingout data away from the crossover region. Statistical errorof each Pad´ e approximant was estimated using the boot-strap method; the bootstrap samples for each computeddata were drawn from a Gaussian distribution centeredaround the mean value of the data and with a standarddeviation equal to the 1σstatistical error of that data. TheﬁnalT-interpolation for each observable was obtained byweighted averaging over all the Pad´ e approximants wherethe weight for an approximant was determined using theAkaike information criterion [29, 30]. This procedure gavereliable results for all the requiredT-derivatives, especiallyforT in the vicinity of the chiral-crossover [10].
We assumed that for all observables the leading dis-cretization errors are of the typea2 ∝1/N2τ. Extrapola-tions to the continuum limita →0 were carried out byﬁtting data at diﬀerentNτ to a function linear in 1/N2τand extrapolating it toNτ → ∞limit. The error oneach continuum-extrapolated result was obtained using theabove described bootstrap method. For all observableswe found that 1/N2τ-ﬁts were satisfactory. To check thesystematics of our continuum extrapolations, we used ﬁtsincluding higher order 1/N4τ corrections, as well as car-ried out the extrapolation procedure using an alternativeT-scale determined using the Sommer parameterr1; allresults were found to be consistent within our errors [10].
4. Results4.1. Zero chemical potential: Tc(0)In Figs. 1 and 3, we show all observables used for thedetermination of pseudo-critical temperatures as deﬁnedin Eq. (7) for lattices withNτ=6, 8, 12, and 16. The re-sults of the temperature interpolations, obtained followingthe procedure described in Sec. 3, are shown by the cor-responding solid bands. Using the interpolated results,and applying the deﬁnitions in Eq. (7), we obtained 5values ofTc(0) forNτ=6, 8, and 12. These results areshown in Fig. 2. Since we have not computedCΣ2 andCχ2 forNτ=16, we only show results for the other 3 def-initions ofTc(0). On coarser lattices, diﬀerent deﬁnitionsresulted in diﬀerent values ofTc(0). These diﬀerences pro-gressively reduce with increasingly ﬁner lattice spacing.
Results ofTc(0) for each of the deﬁnitions were separatelyextrapolated to the continuum (see Sec. 3 for details).
The continuum-extrapolated results for all 5 deﬁnitionsofTc(0) were all consistent with each other within errors.
We took an unweighted average of all the 5 continuum re-sults, and added the statistical errors of each continuum-extrapolation in quadrature to quote our ﬁnal result forthe chiral crossover temperature at zero chemical poten-tialsTc(0) = (156 .5 ±1.5) MeV. It is an interesting factthat continuum results for diﬀerent pseudo-critical tem-peratures coincide within a couple of MeV. However, ifthe value ofT0c [12] is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent fromTc(0),then, based on the scaling properties ofTG,χc (0), it is nat-ural to expect more dispersion among the values ofTc(0).

For thehalf-temperature subtractions we generated ensembles on 483×16, 643×20 and 643×24 latticeswith matching parameters and statistics to their ﬁnite temperature counterparts.
The continuum extrapolated trace anomaly is shown in Figure 3 (left). In parallel to ourinvestigations the hotQCD group is pursuing a similar strategy to calculate the continuum ex-trapolated equation of state using the HISQ action. As of the lattice conference 2012 the resultsappear to be inconsistent [28]. The situation might improve, however, when the HISQ analysisbecomes complete with physical quark masses, a continuum extrapolation and a systematicerror estimate.
The apparent discrepancy in Figure 3 is strongest in the peak region between 200 and 230MeV, thus we have selected a temperature (T ≈214 MeV) where we use an Nt= 16 data pointto demonstrate the continuum scaling for our action. On the r.h.s. of Figure 4 we give the traceanomaly both with and without tree level improvement. The extrapolated values are consistentwith each other, however, tree level improvement results in smaller uncertainties.
An ongoing project of the Wuppertal-Budapest collaboration is the determination of theequation of state with Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 ﬂavors, i.e. including the contribution of the charmquark. This is done using a diﬀerent action with 4 steps of stout smearing with taste breakingartifacts roughly equal to the HISQ action. Our 4-stout action has been tuned independentlyfrom our previous eﬀorts by bracketing the physical point to ±2% in the quark masses, inboxes with Lmπ > 4. The scale was set using the pion decay constant fπ = 130 .41 MeV.
The tuning strategy was pursued to sub-percent accuracy down to a lattice spacing of a ≈0.077 fm, which corresponds to T ≈214 MeV temperature at Nt= 12. Since the contributionof the charm quark is expected to be far below the present accuracy at T = 214 MeV [30],a continuum limit result for the trace anomaly at this temperature, computed using this newaction, provides an independent cross-check of our 2-stout results. Therefore, in order to verifyour 2+1 ﬂavor continuum extrapolation against a diﬀerent action and scale setting techniquewe made dedicated simulations using this 4-stout action at T = 214 MeV. To also check for thevolume dependence here we use the aspect ratio LT = 4. The result for the trace anomaly isshown in on the r.h.s of Figure 4. Lattices up to Nt= 12 are used.

nucleiathighenergy.Itwasconjecturedalreadyin[ 431]that, in such hadronic collisions, after some time localthermal equilibrium is established and all properties ofthe system (fireball) are determined by a single param-eter, the temperatureT, depending on time and spatialcoordinates. This is exactly the regime probed by col-lisions of nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),as will be outlined in the following. The region of finiteto large µB is accessed by nuclear collisions at lowerenergies.
In the following, we describe the experimental ef-forts, principally at the LHC and at RHIC (RelativisticHeavy Ion Collider), to provide from analysis of rela-tivistic nuclear collision data quantitative informationon the QCD phase diagram by studying hadron pro-duction as a function of the nucleon-nucleon center ofmass energy√sNN. We can only touch a small fractionof the physics of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in thisbrief review. Excellent summaries of the many other in-7.1 QGP 243teresting topics can be found in recent review articles[2126–2129].
In the early phase of the collision, the incoming nu-clei lose a large fraction of their energy leading to thecreation of a hot fireball characterized by an energydensityϵand a temperatureT. This stopping is charac-terized by the average rapidity shift of the incident nu-cleons, with∆y= -ln(E/E0). Quantitative informationis contained in the experimentally measured net-protonrapidity distributions (i.e. the difference between pro-ton and anti-proton rapidity distributions). These dis-tributions are presented for different collision energiesfrom the SPS to RHIC energy range in [2130]. There itcan be seen that the rapidity shift saturates at approxi-mately two units from√sNN ≈17.3 GeV upwards, im-plying a fractional energy loss of1 −exp(−∆y) ≈86%.
In fact, the same rapidity shift was already determinedfor p–nucleus collisions at Fermilab for 200 GeV/c pro-ton momentum [2131]. With increasing collision energy,the target and projectile rapidity ranges are well sepa-rated, leaving at central rapidity a net-baryon depletedor even free high energy density region. Fig.7.1.3 showsthe distribution of slowed down beam nucleons, aftersubtracting the tail of the target distribution and plot-ted against rapidity minus beam rapidity. It is apparentthat up to√sNN = 62.4 GeV the concept of limitingfragmentation [2132] is well realized. At higher energies,this rapidity region is very hard to reach experimentallyfor identified particles.
The rapidity shift of the incident nucleons leads tohigh energy densities at central rapidity, i.e., in the cen-6−4 −2 −0 2 shy00.20.4sh)/dy B /2> dN(B- W 1/100GeV.Thenet-baryon-freeQGPpresumablyexistedintheearlyUniverseafter73 The values reported in the table are all for vanishing chemi-cal potentials. We have evaluated the differences if one assumesvalues for chemical potentials as determined at chemical freeze-out, see below. The resulting temperature values differ by lessthan 5% from those reported in Table7.1.1. Owing to the pro-portionality of energy density to the fourth power of tempera-ture, inclusion of a bag pressure only mildly changes the calcu-lated temperature values.244 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS00.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 )c (GeV/Tp00.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.180.20.222Flow coefficient v = 2.76 TeV, 10-20 %NNsALICE data, Pb-Pb +π+KpΛ-Ξ-ΩHydro modelVISHNU (Phys.

the electro-weak phase transition and up to a few mi-croseconds after the Big Bang74. On the other hand,a baryon-rich QGP could be populated in neutron starmergers or could exist, at very low temperatures, in thecenter of neutron stars[2140, 2141].
For the system considered to come into local ther-mal equilibrium and, more importantly, for the devel-opment of a phase transition, the presence of interac-tions is necessary. In fact, close to the phase transition,the system has to be strongly coupled. As mentionedabove, quarks and gluons under the extreme conditionsreached in nuclear collisions are indeed strongly cou-pled. The large values of the interaction measure fromlQCD calculations (ϵ−3P)/T4, introduced above inFig. 7.1.2, lend support to the strong coupling scenario.
Further, the energy and entropy densities ϵ/T4 ands/T3, as calculated in lQCD, fall significantly short (byabout 20 %) of the Stefan-Boltzmann limit for an idealgas of quarks and gluons up to a few times the pseudo-critical temperature. The conclusion about a stronglycoupled QGP close toTpc also follows from experimen-tal results at the colliders, and even at the SPS, on thecoefficients of azimuthal anisotropies of hadron distri-butions in combination with a viscous hydrodynamicdescription.
For non-central nuclear collisions the distributionsin transverse momentumpT of hadrons exhibit modula-tions with respect to the azimuthal angleφin the reac-tion plane. These anisotropies can be characterized bypT dependent Fourier coefficients. The dominant termis the 2nd order Fourier coefficientv2, also called the74 In the QGP of the early universe, particles interacting viathe strong and electro-weak force are part of the system, whilean accelerator-made QGP only contains strongly interactingparticles.

elliptic flow coefficient. This modulation has been pre-dictedtoarisefromtheanisotropyofthegradientofthepressure P in the early phase of the collision due to thegeometry of the nuclear overlap region, leading to cor-respondingly larger expansion velocities in the reactionplane and hence largev2 coefficients.
The strength of the coupling can be quantified byintroducing transport parameters for the QGP such asthe shear viscosityη, which is related to the mean freepath of quarks and gluons inside the QGP, and thebulk viscosityζ, with its connection to QGP expansiondynamicsandspeedofsound.Thesmallerthetransportcoefficients the stronger the coupling. Larger values ofthe shear viscosity, e.g., suppress the magnitude of theelliptic flow.
For a strongly coupled system with small enoughvalues of mean free path (comparable to or lower thanthe corresponding de Broglie wavelength of particles),treatment as a fluid is more appropriate. One then de-scribes its properties by solving hydrodynamic equa-tions.Theshearviscosityentersthehydrodynamicequa-tions asη/(ϵ+P) = η/(Ts), hence the quantity charac-terizing the medium isη/s. By comparing flow observ-ables measured in experiments at RHIC [2144, 2145]and LHC [2146] to the corresponding calculations inviscous hydrodynamics, accompanied with convertingthe fluid into thermal distributions of hadrons at thefreeze-out hyper-surface, remarkably low values forη/sare obtained. Fig.7.1.4 shows as an example the ellip-tic flow coefficientsv2 for different identified hadrons atthe LHC. A mass ordering characteristic for a hydrody-namically expanding medium is observed very clearly.
And indeed, the mass ordering and itspT dependenceare described quantitatively by a relativistic viscous hy-drodynamic calculation [2142] as indicated by the linesin Fig.7.1.4 employing a small ratio ofη/s.
In fact, a lower bound ofη/s = 1 /(4π) (in units ofℏ = kB = 1)canbeobtainedforalargeclassofstronglycoupled field theories from the quantum mechanicaluncertainty principle [2147] and using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence [2055, 2148, 2149]. Recently, the values7.1 QGP 245and the temperature dependence of the shear and bulkviscosities employed in hydrodynamic codes were ex-tracted by fitting spectra and azimuthal anisotropies ofhadronsmeasuredattheLHCandRHICusingBayesianestimation methods [2143, 2150]. An example is shownin Fig. 7.1.5. Inspection of this figure indicates that,at Tpc, the estimated value ofη/s is close to the lowerbound of1/(4π) , indicating that the observed matteris a nearly perfect fluid. Above the transition temper-ature, the extracted band for η/s is rising, reflectinga weakening of the coupling, although even at twiceTpc the medium is still strongly coupled. On the otherhand, as presented in Fig.7.1.2, near the phase transi-tion the lQCD results exhibit a maximum in the inter-action measure, which is an indication for interactionsin the system. In the hydrodynamic calculations thebreaking of scale invariance is accounted for by intro-ducing a bulk viscosityζ along with the shear viscosity.
While increasing sheer viscosity reduces the momentumanisotropy, hence lowering the elliptic flow coefficients,the bulk viscosity reduces the overall rate of the radialexpansion. The right panel of Fig.7.1.5 shows the tem-perature dependence ofζ/s, which exhibits a peak justabove the transition temperature [2143]. This locationof the maximum is consistent with the temperature de-pendence of the interaction measure from lQCD.
Important information on the structure of the QGPis also obtained by studying the interaction of high-momentum partons with the thermalized quarks andgluons in the QGP. A strongly coupled QGP is opaqueto high momentum partons, leading to the phenomenonof ’jet quenching’ [2129]. In fact, the theoretical founda-tion for strong jet quenching by QCD bremsstrahlungwas laid by [2151]. There it was shown that, for suffi-ciently energetic quarks and gluons, such that the ra-diation does not decohere, the radiative energy lossscales quadratically with the length traversed, leadingtoverylargevalues.Animportantexperimentalobserv-able linked to jet quenching is the observed suppression(’quenching’) of high-momentum hadrons in central nu-clearcollisionsathighcollisionenergy.Thissuppressionis quantified by the pT dependence of the ratio RAA ofinclusive hadron production in collisions of nuclei withmass number A to that in proton-proton collisions, tak-ing into account the collision geometry by scaling to thenumber of binary collisions [2129].
In Fig. 7.1.6 we present the evolution with cm en-ergy of the transverse momentum dependence of RAAfor leading particles as obtained from measurements atthe SPS, RHIC, and LHC accelerators. Note that, byconstruction, RAA = 1 for hard binary collisions in theabsence of nuclear effect such as jet quenching. At verylow pT one observes RAA values less than unity andFig. 7.1.6Evolution of the transverse momentum dependenceof RAA for leading particles for central nuclear collisions withcollision energy[2152].
increasing with pT since soft particle production scaleswith the number of participating nucleons and not thenumber of binary collisions. For RHIC and LHC ener-gies the jet quenching is born out by a decreasing trendobserved for pT > 2.5 GeV/c reaching a broad mini-mum near pT = 7 GeV/c of RAA = 0.1 −0.2: high mo-mentum hadrons are quenched by about a factor of 5 ormore. At LHC energies RAA increases again for higherpT values until a plateau is reached above pT ≈100GeV/c. Measurements for fully reconstructed jets havebeen performed by the ATLAS collaboration. The re-sults demonstrate [2153] that the quenching by about afactor of 2 persists to the highest available jet pT valuesof 1 TeV/c.
The data on jet quenching have been modeled interms of elastic and inelastic collisions of partons in thedense QGP, taking into account important coherenceeffects [2154, 2155]. For a recent summary see [2156]and ref. cited there.
To model experimental data with QCD-based jetquenchingcalculationsonehastotakeintoaccountthatthe jet is created as a product of an initial hard parton-parton collision with large momentum transfer Q. Thatimplies that the parton initiating the jet is highly vir-tual. The magnitude of its 4-momentum Q as reflectedin the total jet energy E can be hundreds of GeV (oreven a few TeV at the LHC) while, for a real parton,Q2 ≈0. The highly virtual parton will evolve into aparton shower which eventually hadronizes to form acollimated jet of hadrons. During the entire evolutionthe highly virtual initial parton and the parton shower246 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONSFig. 7.1.7QGP jet transport parameterˆq/T3 obtained by theJETSCAPE collaboration[2156].
components lose energy by interactions with the QGPconstituents, resulting in a medium-modification of theentire parton fragmentation pattern, i.e. the jet [2154].
The most modern jet quenching analyses take into ac-count the different regimes of parton virtuality as de-scribed in [ 2156]. The calculations have as leadinginput parameter a jet transport coefficient ˆ qthat isdetermined by the differential mean squared momen-tum transfer ⟨k2t⟩ between jet parton and the QGPconstituents with respect to the length traversed, i.e.
ˆ q =d⟨k2t⟩/dL.
The recent analysis by the JETSCAPE collabora-tion [2156] uses data on inclusive hadron suppressionfrom central Au-Au collisions at RHIC and Pb-Pb col-lisions at LHC, applying a Bayesian parameter esti-mation to determine the temperature dependence ofthe dimensionless, renormalized jet transport parame-ter ˆ q/T3. The calculations are based on two differentmodels for parton energy loss, called MATTER andLBT, to effectively cover the large range of parton vir-tualities. A switch-over between the virtuality-orderedsplitting dominated regime and the time-ordered trans-port dominated regime happens at low virtualities ofQ0 = 2 −2.7 GeV. The results are shown in Fig.7.1.7.
Note that the plot is for a parton momentum of 100GeV/c, but as demonstrated in [2156] the momentumdependence is rather mild. To put the results into con-text, a value ofˆ q/T3 = 4 implies that, at temperatureT = 0.4 GeV,ˆ q≈1.3 GeV2/fm. This value should becompared to what was determined for parton energyloss in cold nuclear matter. Analysis of data for deepinelastic scattering off large nuclei [2157] yielded a valueof ˆ q = 0.024 ±0.008 GeV2/fm. A global analysis of thejet transport coefficient for cold nuclear matter was per-formed recently in [2158]. These authors obtain valuesof ˆ q<0.03 GeV2/fm over a wide range of (xB,Q2) val-ues (here, xB is the Bjorken x parameter). We concludethat, for high energy partons, the stopping power ofa QGP formed at RHIC or LHC energy is increasedby more than a factor of 40 compared to that for coldnuclear matter.

Direct experimental access to the QCD phase dia-gram is obtained from the measurement of the yieldsof hadrons produced in (central) high energy nuclearcollisions. Analysis of these data in terms of the Statis-tical Hadronization Model (SHM), see [2159] and refs.
given there, established that, at hadronization, the fire-ball formed in the collision is very close to a state in full(hadro-)chemical equilibrium.
The essential idea in the SHM is to approximate thepartition function of the system by that of an ideal gascomposed of all stable hadrons and resonances, hencealso referred to as the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG)model, see [2159]. From this partition function one cancalculate the first moments (mean values) of densitiesof hadrons as a function of a pair of thermodynamic pa-rameters, the temperatureTchem and the baryon chem-ical potentialµB at chemical freeze-out. To go beyondtheidealgasapproximation,attractiveandrepulsivein-teractionsbetweenhadronscanbetakenintoaccountinthe S-matrix formulation of statistical mechanics [2160]by including the first term in the virial expansion. Ide-ally, the relevant coefficients are obtained from mea-sured phase shifts. For the pion-nucleon interaction thiswasimplementedin[ 2161]andtheprotonyieldforLHCenergy was corrected accordingly [2162]. The predic-tions of the SHM for hadron yields are compared to ex-perimental data at LHC energy forTchem = 156.5 MeVin Fig.7.1.8. The agreement is excellent for the yieldsof all measured hadrons, nuclei and hyper-nuclei andtheir anti-particles, with yields varying over 9 orders ofmagnitude. Remarkably, the description works equallywell for loosely bound states. This has led to the con-jecture of hadronization into compact multi-quark bagswith the right quantum numbers evolving into the fi-nal nuclear wave functions in accordance with quantummechanics [2159].
The values of the hadro-chemical freeze-out param-eters at lower collisions energies are similarly obtainedby fitting the SHM results to the measured hadronyields. The extracted freeze-out parametersTchem andµB [2159, 2163] are presented as red symbols in theQCD phase diagram shown in Fig.7.1.9.

of charm quarks leads to a fugacity in the SHM forcharmed hadrons [4] which is, however, not a free pa-rameter but determined by the measured charm crosssection. Charm quarks are not conﬁned inside the QGP,thermalize within the QGP and hadronize at the QCDphase boundary into open and hidden charm hadrons.
This SHM for charmed hadrons (SHMC) provides anexcellent description of charmonium production [5–7]without any new parameters and represents compellingevidence, as demonstrated in Figure 1, for this new pro-duction mechanism. A more detailed account of theSHMC is given below.
Furthermore, a large degree of thermalization is ob-served in the spectra and the elliptic ﬂow of D-mesonsand their decay electrons [8, 9]. A number of re-cent measurements have established the SHMC process(sometimes dubbed ‘(re)generation’) as the dominantproduction mechanism of J/ψin heavy-ion collisions atLHC energies [10–13]. It is therefore appealing and im-portant to extend the intriguing results of J/ψproductionbeyond yields to particle spectra and to more complexcharmonium as well as open charm states to further in-vestigate the SHMC mechanism. In the present publica-tion we focus on charmonium states. Predictions for theopen charm sector will be the subject of a future publi-cation.
Loosely bound states such as ψ(2S) and, more dra-matically, the potential tetra-quark charmonium stateX(3872) are of particular interest. Its observation bythe Belle collaboration [14] and the subsequent conﬁr-mation by the CDF [15], D0 [16], and BaBar [17] col-laborations showed that it is a narrow charmonium-likeresonance and the close vicinity of the particle mass tothe D0 ¯D∗0 production threshold suggests that the parti-cle could be a charm meson molecule with a very smallbinding energy [18]. At the LHC, the state X(3872) wasﬁrst observed by the LHCb collaboration [19], whichlater also determined [20, 21] its quantum numbers,JPC = 1++.
In addition to the X(3872), the ψ(2S) is a naturalchoice when expanding the studies on the SHMC mech-anism beyond the J/ψ.
In this letter, we present calculations for the yieldsand transverse momentum spectra of the charmoniumstates J/ψ, ψ(2S), and X(3872) for heavy-ion collisionsat √sNN = 5 TeV . Results will be presented for the cur-rent collision system Pb–Pb and, in the case of X(3872),also for Kr–Kr collisions where much larger luminosi-ties are possible at the LHC.
2. Heavy quarks in the statistical hadronizationmodelIn the SHMC it is assumed that charm quarks 2 areproduced in initial hard scatterings and that during theQGP phase the number of (anti-)charm quarks is con-served, i.e. the thermal production or annihilation arenegligible at LHC energies [5]. The color charge ofcharm quarks is screened by the color-dense mediumfor T ≳ TCF = 156.5 MeV and they do not form color-less bound states in the ﬁreball volume V, where µB isconsistent with zero for LHC energies, as determinedby thermal ﬁts, see [2]. The quarks thermalize in theQGP before the hadronization and rapid freeze-out atthe phase boundary.

be compared to the crossover chiral phase transitionline as computed in lQCD (blue band). From LHC en-ergies down to about √sNN = 12 GeV, i.e., over theentire range covered by lQCD, there is a remarkableagreement betweenTchem and the pseudo-critical tem-peratureforthechiralcrossovertransition Tpc.Wenotethat, along this phase boundary, the energy densitycomputed (for 2 quark flavors) from the values ofTchemand µB exhibits a nearly constant value ofϵcrit ≈0.46GeV/fm3.
The finding that the hadro-chemical freeze-out tem-perature is very close to Tpc has a fundamental con-sequence: because of the very rapid temperature anddensity change across the phase transition and the re-sulting low hadron densities in the fireball combinedwith its size, the produced hadrons cease to interact in-elastically within a narrow temperature interval [2165]after hadron formation.
This is very different from particle freeze-out in theearlyuniversewherefortemperatures T >10 MeVeventhe mean free path for neutrinos is much smaller thanits size, see section 22.3 of [476].
For large values of baryon chemical potential, ex-perimental data for hadron-chemical freeze-out existbut the phase structure of strongly interacting matterremains uncertain; various model calculations suggestthe appearance of a line of first order phase transition,which in combination with the crossover transition atsmaller values of µB, would imply the existence of acritical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram asindicated in Fig.7.1.9. The experimental discovery ofthe CEP would mark a major break-through in our un-derstanding of the QCD phase structure.

of the CEP is most likely in the regionµB >470 MeV,based mostly on results from lQCD. Searching for theCEP is the subject of a very active research program, atRHIC and the future FAIR facility at GSI. The impor-tance of this research is underlined by the realizationthat we have currently no experimental evidence forthe order of the chiral phase transition at any value ofbaryon chemical potential.
Important further information on the phase struc-ture of QCD matter is expected by measuring, in ad-dition to the first moments of hadron production data,also higher moments as such data can be directly con-nected to the QCD partition function via conservedcharge number susceptibilities in the Grand CanonicalEnsemble (GCE) [2166, 2167]. For a thermal system ofvolume V and temperatureT the susceptibilities in theGCE are defined as the coefficients in the Maclaurinseries of the reduced pressureˆP = P(T,V,⃗ µ)/T4χqn ≡∂n ˆP∂ˆµnq= 1VT 3∂nlnZ(V,T,⃗ µ)∂ˆµnq= κn(Nq)VT 3 , (7.1.2)where ⃗ µ= {µB,µQ,µS}is the chemical potential vec-tor that is introduced to conserve, on average, baryonnumber, electric charge and strangeness. Here, ˆµq =µq/T is the reduced chemical potential for the con-served charges q ∈ {B,Q,S }. The partition functionZ(V,T,⃗ µ) encodes the Equation of State (EoS) of the248 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONSsystem under consideration. Eq.7.1.2 establishes a di-rect link between susceptibilities and fluctuations ofconservedchargenumbers.Bymeasuringcumulants κn(Nq)of net-charge number (Nq) distributions one can, usingEq. 7.1.2, further probe and quantify the nature of theQCD phase transition.
Important at this point is to define a non-criticalbaseline, which is done by using the ideal gas EoS, ex-tended such as to account for event-by-event chargeconservation and correlations in rapidity space [2130,2168, 2169], see also [ 2170]. In addition, non-criticalcontributionsarising,e.g.,fromfluctuationsofwoundednucleons [2171, 2172] need to be corrected for. Devia-tionsfromthisnon-criticalbaseline,forexampleleadingto negative values ofκ6 for net-baryons would arise dueto the closeness of the cross over transition to the O(4)2nd order critical phase transition for vanishing lightquark masses [2173].
In Fig. 7.1.10 the ALICE results on the normal-ized second order cumulants of net-proton distributionsare presented as function of the experimental accep-tance. The acceptance is quantified via the pseudo-rapidity coverage around mid-rapidity∆η [2174–2176].
The measured cumulant values approach unity at smallvalues of∆η, essentially driven by small number Pois-sonstatistics.Withincreasingacceptance,thedatapro-gressively decrease from unity. For small but finite ac-ceptance the decrease can be fully accounted for byoverall baryon number conservation in full phase space.
Hence,aftercorrectingforbaryonnumberconservation,the experimental data would be consistent with unityover the range of the experimental acceptance.
This observation has three important consequences.
(i) It shows that, up to second order, cumulants of thebaryon number distribution functions follow a poisso-nian distribution, a posteriori justifying the assump-tions underlying the construction of the partition func-tion used in the SHM. (ii) This is the first experi-mental verification of lQCD results which also predictunity for the second order scaled cumulants of baryondistributions. (iii) Compared to the different calcula-tions, the data imply long range correlations in rapid-ity space, calling into question the baryon productionmechanism implemented in string fragmentation mod-els. Indeed, the results from the HIJING event gener-ator based on the Lund String Fragmentation modelshown in Fig.7.1.10, due to the typical correlation overabout one unit of rapidity, grossly overpredict the sup-pression due to baryon number conservation [2177].
Contrary to the detailed predictions for signals inthe cross-over region of the transition covered by lQCD,no quantitative signals are available for the existenceof a possible critical end point in the phase diagram.

The colored lines correspond to calculations accounting forbaryon number conservation with different correlation lengthin rapidity space [2169]. The results of the HIJING event gen-erator are presented with the black solid line.
All predicted signals are of generic nature and mostlybased on searching for non-monotonic behavior in theexcitation function of fourth order cumulants of, e.g.,net-protons[2178].Acompilationoftherespectivemea-surements [2179, 2180] is presented in Fig.7.1.11. Thesearch for non-monotonic behaviour needs a startingpoint. In Fig. 7.1.11 two possibilities are presented,one corresponding to calculations in HRG within GCE(dashed line at unity) and the other the non-criticalbaselineintroducedabovewherebaryonnumberconser-vation is explicitly accounted for (red solid line or bluesymbols). With respect to unity the data indeed exhibitan indication for non-monotonic behaviour with a sig-nificancecorrespondingto3.1standarddeviations[ 2180].
However, a significant part of this deviation from unityis induced by non-critical effects, such as baryon num-ber conservation. Therefore, one must search for non-monotonic behaviour with respect to the red solid line.
Analysis of the data shows that there are no significantdeviations from a statistical ensemble with event-by-event baryon number conservation, i.e, within the cur-rent precision of the data there is not yet evidence forthe presence of a critical end point [2130, 2168]. Theanalysis of fourth order cumulants from a much higherstatistics data set has just started and will be essentialfor a possible discovery of the critical point.
The current status on experimental verification ofthe nature of the chiral cross-over transition at vanish-ing or moderateµB is still rather open.

inspired model calculations [2181, 2182], based on O(4)scaling functions the predicted sixth order cumulantsfor net-baryon distributions exhibit negative values atTpc due to a singular term in the pressure. Similarly,the sixth order susceptibilities of baryon number re-sulting from lQCD calculations are also negative [2173,2183] and this sign change (relative to the HRG base-line in GCE) has been linked to the critical componentin the pressure present as a residue of the 2nd order chi-ral phase transition for vanishing (u,d) quark masses,due to the smallness of the physical masses. First ex-perimental results on sixth order net-proton cumulantswere reported by the STAR collaboration [2184] forAu–Au collisions, albeit with sizeable statistical uncer-tainties since the data analysis to determine high ordercumulants is extremely statistics hungry. Qualitatively,the STAR results at√sNN = 200 GeV are indeed con-sistent with the expectations for the crossover transi-tion. At the same time, the experimentally measuredenergy dependence of κ6 [2184] is at odds with bothmodel and lQCD calculations. For a quantitative con-clusion, in any case, the effects of baryon number con-servation [2130] and transformation from net-protons(experiment) to net-baryons (theory) [2185] are still tobe performed. So far, experimental insight into the na-ture of the chiral cross-over transition and the devel-opment towards low net-baryon densities remains in-conclusive. It can be expected that ongoing and futurehigh statistics measurement campaigns by the STARand ALICE collaborations will elucidate the situation.
There is now significant experimental information,from relativistic nuclear collisions, not only on the pro-ductionofhadronscomposedoflight(u,d,s)quarks,butalso of open and hidden charm and beauty hadrons. Inparticular, there is good evidence, mainly from resultsobtained at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)[2186–2188], that charm quarks reach a large degreeof thermal equilibrium, although charm quarks in thesystem are chemically far out of equilibrium. This issupported by heavy quark diffusion coefficients fromlQCD [2189]. A strong indication for equilibration isthe fact that J/ψ mesons participate in the collective,anisotropic hydrodynamic expansion [2190, 2191].
To microscopically understand the production me-chanism of charmed hadrons for systems ranging frompptoPb–Pb,variousformsofquarkcoalescencemodelshave been developed [2192–2196]. This provides a nat-ural way to study the dependence of production yieldson hadron size and, hence, may help to settle the stillopen question whether the many exotic hadrons thathave been observed recently are compact multi-quarkstates or hadronic molecules (see [2197, 2198] and refs.
cited there). Conceptual difficulties with this approachare that energy is not conserved in the coalescence pro-cess and that color neutralization at hadronization re-quires additional assumptions about quark correlationsin the QGP [2199].
Another approach, named SHMc, has been madepossible by the extension of the SHM to also incorpo-rate charm quarks. This was first proposed in [2200]and developed further in [ 2159, 2187, 2201–2204] toinclude all hadrons with hidden and open charm. Thekey idea is based on the recognition that, contrary towhat happens in the (u,d,s) sector, the heavy (mass∼1.2 GeV) charm quarks are not thermally produced.
Rather, production takes place in initial hard collisions.
The produced charm quarks then thermalize in the hotfireball, but the total number of charm quarks is con-served during the evolution of the fireball [2204] sincecharm quark annihilation is very small. In essence, thisimplies that charm quarks can be treated like impu-rities. Their thermal description then requires the in-troduction of a charm fugacity gc [2187, 2200]. Thevalue ofgc is not a free parameter but experimentallydetermined by measurement of the total charm crosssection. For central Pb–Pb collisions at LHC energy,gc ≈30 [2187]. The charmed hadrons are, in the SHMc,all formed at the phase boundary, i.e. at hadronization,in the same way as all (u,d,s) hadrons.

the uncertainty in the prediction is mainly caused bythe uncertainty in the total charm cross section in Pb–Pb collisions. We note here that, because of the forma-tion from deconfined charm quarks at the phase bound-ary, charmonia are unbound inside the QGP but theirfinal yield exhibits enhancement compared to expecta-tions using collision scaling from pp collisions, contraryto the original predictions based on [2112]. For a de-tailed discussion see [2159].
For the description of yields of charmonia, feedingfrom excited charmonia is very small because of theirstrong Boltzmann suppression. For open charm mesonsand baryons, this is not the case and feeding from ex-cited D∗ and Λ∗c is an essential ingredient for the de-scription of open charm hadrons [2187]. Even thoughthe experimental delineation of the mass spectrum ofexcited open charm mesons and baryons is currentlyfar from complete, the prediction of yields for D-mesonsand Λc baryons compares very well with the measure-ments75, both concerning transverse momentum andcentrality dependence.
A particularly transparent way to look at the datafor Pb–Pb collisions is obtained by analyzing the cen-tralitydependenceoftheyieldratio D0/(J/ψ) andcom-paring the results to the predictions of the SHMc. Re-cently, both theD0 and J/ψ production cross sectionshave been well measured down topt = 0. The yieldratio D0/(J/ψ) is reproduced with very good preci-sion for both measured centralities, as demonstratedin Fig. 7.1.12. This result lends strong support to theassumptionthatopenandhiddencharmstatesarebothproducedbystatisticalhadronizationatthephasebound-75 ForΛc baryons on has to augment the currently measuredcharm baryon spectrum with additional states to achieve com-plete agreement with experimental data [2187].
ary. A more extensive comparison between SHMc anddata for open charm hadrons is shown in [2187].
From the successful comparison of measured yieldsfor the production of (u,d,s) as well as open and hiddencharm hadrons obtained from the SHM or SHMc withessentially only the temperature as a free parameter atLHC energies, one may draw a number of importantconclusions.
– First, we note that hadron production in relativisticnuclear collisions is described quantitatively by thechemical freeze-out parameters (Tchem,µB). Notethat the fireball volume appearing in the partitionfunction is determined by normalization to the mea-sured number of charged particles. At least for en-ergies √sNN ≥10 GeV these freeze-out parame-ters agree with good precision with the results fromlQCD for the location of the chiral cross over transi-tion. Under these conditions, hadronization is inde-pendent of particle species and only dependent onthe values ofT and µB at the phase boundary. AtLHC energy, the chemical potential vanishes, andonly T = Tpc is needed to describe hadronization.
– The mechanism implemented in the SHMc for theproduction of charmed hadrons implies that theseparticles are produced from uncorrelated, thermal-ized charm quarks as is expected for a strongly cou-pled, deconfined QGP (see also the discussion in[2187]). At LHC energy, where chemical freeze-outtakes place for central Pb–Pb collisions in a volumeper unit rapidity ofV ≈4000 fm3, this implies thatcharm quarks can travel over linear distances of or-der 10 fm (see [2159, 2187] for more detail).
One may ask whether there is a possible contribu-tion to the production of charmed hadrons (in partic-ular of J/ψ) from the hadronic phase. At the phaseboundary,assemblyofJ/ ψfromdeconfinedcharmquarksor from all possible charmed hadrons is indistinguish-able, as discussed in detail in [2159]. In fact, in [2165] itwas demonstrated that multi-hadron collisions lead tovery rapid thermal population, while within very fewMeV below the phase boundary, the system falls out ofequilibrium. Both is driven by the rapid drop of entropyand thereby particle density in the vicinity ofTpc. Inthe confined hadronic phase, i.e. for temperatures lowerthan Tpc, the hadron gas is off-equilibrium, and any cal-culation via reactions of the typeD¯D∗ ↔nπJ/ψhas toimplement the back-reaction [2206]. Since predictionswith the SHMc agree very well with the data for J/ψproduction at an accuracy of about 10%, and since anypossible hadronic contribution has to be added to theSHMc value, we estimate any contribution to J/ψ pro-duction from the confined phase to be less than 10%.7.2 QCD at high density 251Future measurement campaigns at the LHC willyield detailed information on the production cross sec-tions of hadrons with multiple charm quarks as well asexcited charmonia. The predictions from the SHMc fortherelevantcrosssectionsexhibitaratherdramatichie-rarchy of enhancements [2187] for such processes. Expe-rimental tests of these predictions would lead to a fun-damental understanding of confinement/deconfinementand hadronization.
7.2 QCD at high densityKenji F ukushima7.2.1 QCD Phase DiagramThe QCD vacuum has rich contents, very different froman empty “vacuum” but rather close to a medium. Therelevant physical degrees of freedom can change accord-ing to the probe resolution to the medium. As longas the typical momentum scale in physical processes islargecomparedtotheQCDscale,i.e., ΛQCD ∼200 MeV,observed particles – all hadrons including mesons andbaryons – are only color-singlet composites. The typicalscale of hadronic masses and radii is characterized byΛQCD or Λ−1QCD ∼1 fm. Therefore, if hadronic matter iscompressed so that the interparticle distance becomescomparable toΛ−1QCD, wavefunctions of hadrons overlapeach other. Then, hadrons are no longer isolated andmore elementary particles should take over the physi-cal degrees of freedom.
High compression of QCD matter is achieved by in-creasing the particle number density. Actually, if matteris heated up, the density of massless thermal excitationsincreases as ∼T3 which corresponds to the scaling ofinterparticle distance∝T−1. If the baryon density,nB,is increased in the same way, the average distance be-tween baryons should scale as∝n−1/3B . It is hence nat-ural to expect a phase boundary in the plane ofT andnB from hadronic matter to a new state of matter com-posed of quarks and gluons, which portrays the QCDphase diagram.
The idea of the QCD phase diagram was first castinto a concrete shape by Cabibbo and Parisi [428] basedon the conjecture of Hagedorn’s limiting temperature.
Let us briefly look over the theory foundations accord-ingtoexplanationsinRef.[ 2207].Thethermalpartitionfunction at finiteT but zero density reads:ZM =∫dmρM(m) e−m/T , (7.2.1)wheredmρM(m) representsthenumberofmesonicstateswithin the mass window,m ∼m+ dm. The last ex-ponential factor appears from the thermal Boltzmannweight. The density of states associated with degener-acy is increasing for larger eigen-energies, and soρM(m)is an increasing function ofm. It is empirically knownthat ρM(m) ∼em/TH with a phenomenological param-eter TH called the Hagedorn temperature. Because thelogarithm of the combinatorial factor for a given energyis nothing but the entropy, this exponentially increas-ing ρM(m) means that the entropy grows linearly withm. As seen from Eq. (7.2.1), the m integration inZMblows up forT > TH for which the entropy enhance-ment overwhelms the energy suppression and the freeenergy is bottomlessly pushed down with increasingm.
Hagedorn proposed thatTH is interpreted as the upperbound of the physically possible temperature. Later on,a physically sensible interpretation was clarified thatthe singularity inZM should be overridden by a phasetransition, possibly the one to a state with more fun-damental degrees of freedom. The critical temperaturefrom mesonic matter to deconfined matter with quarksand gluons is thusT(M)c = TH.
The above mentioned argument can be generalizedto the case at finite baryon density. Then, the partitionfunction isZB =∫dmρB(m) e−(m−µB )/T , (7.2.2)where the Boltzmann factor depends on the baryonchemical potential µB. The experimental data implythat the baryonic spectrum exhibits ρB(m) ∝em/T′Hwith the baryonic Hagedorn temperature,T′H, that isslightly different fromTH. The critical temperature forbaryons is deduced from the singularity asT(B)c = T′H −(T′H/m0)µB, which is derived from an approximationthattheBoltzmannfactorisreplacedby e−m(1−µB /m0)/Twith a phenomenological parameter,m0 (see Ref. [2207]for detailed discussions).
Now, supposing thatT′H >TH, the critical temper-ature for the deconfinement transition is dominantlycharacterized by mesonic T(M)c in the low density re-gion at µB ≪ T. With increasing µB, the two linesof constantT(M)c and decreasingT(B)c cross eventually.
This consideration leads us to a picture of the phasediagram on the plane of the baryon density (along thehorizontal axis) and the temperature (along the verti-cal axis) as illustrated in Fig.7.2.1. This QCD phasediagram handwritten by Gordon Baym (see Ref. [2208]for more historical backgrounds) has played a role ofprototype of the contemporary QCD phase diagram.
So far, we addressed only the deconfinement phasetransition associated with the liberation of quarks andgluons in hot and dense media. The theoretical de-scription of deconfinement in the presence of dynamicalquarks is subtle, however. One may think that each252 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONSFig. 7.2.1A prototype of the QCD phase diagram. The hand-written phase diagram recaptured in Ref. [2208] was adaptedand colorized here.
phase separated by phase boundaries should be dis-tinctly defined by a different realization of some globalsymmetry but for the deconfinement phenomenon, thesymmetry corresponding to quark confinement/decon-finement (known ascenter symmetry [439] that is a 1-form symmetry in finite-T quantum field theory [1265])is not exact but approximate. Still, as long as the ap-proximate symmetry is barely broken, an approximatevalue of critical temperature called thepseudo-criticaltemperature can be prescribed. Therefore, the temper-ature at which the deconfinement takes place is notuniquely defined but the pseudo-critical temperature isinevitably scheme dependent. This is why some theo-retical QCD phase diagrams show the phase boundarywith an uncertainty band associated with non-uniquepseudo-critical temperatures.
The deconfined phase of gluons corresponds to thevacuum with spontaneous breaking of center symme-try, while quarks explicitly break this symmetry. Here,we shall avoid cumbersome mathematics and limit our-selves to pedagogical explanations about center sym-metry. Let us consider a free energy gain,fq(x), in re-sponse to a test quark placed atx, and then constructa quantity called the Polyakov loop:L(x) = e−fq (x)/T . (7.2.3)If the gluonic medium confines quarks, on the one hand,fq →∞ leads toL→0. Here we note that in a homoge-neoussystemthe x dependenceoftheexpectationvaluecan be safely dropped. On the other hand,L remainsnonvanishing in the deconfined phase with fq < ∞.
Thus, L serves as an order parameter for quark con-finement, and in quantum field theoryL is expressedby an expectation value of a 1-form line operator (i.e.,Fig. 7.2.2 The QCD string extends between a pair of testquark and antiquark (upper figure). The string breaking occursonce the fluxtube energy exceeds the meson mass (lower figure).
Wilson line), see Ref. [1265] for generalized higher-formsymmetries.
In reality with dynamical quarks, fq would neverdiverge. The reason is easy to understand. A single testquark is a source to which a color fluxtube is attached.
The color field energy is proportional to the squeezedfluxtube length. Thus, in a purely gluonic medium, atest quark cannot be screened and the fluxtube goesto spatial infinity, yieldingfq →∞ and thus L →0if confined. Fluctuations of dynamical quarks allow forthe creation of a quark and an antiquark pair once thefluxtube energy exceeds the mesonic mass threshold asillustrated in Fig. 7.2.2. Then, the color field energystored between a test quark and a test antiquark can-not become greater than twice the mesonic massMV.
That is, the clustering decomposition property indi-cates L(0)L†(x) ∼e−2MV/T for sufficiently large |x|,and soL∼e−MV/T >0 even in the confined hadronicphase.
This argument implies that the QCD string is fur-ther breached by fluctuations of surrounding quarksand holes at finite density. In other words the explicitbreaking of center symmetry is enlarged in high-densitymatter and the mathematical concept of quark confine-ment would be obscure. Not that we do not yet finda better order parameter. The absence of the decon-finement order parameter could be attributed to theprofound nature of dense QCD matter; namely, dualityfrom hadronic to quark matter.
Now, let us shift gear to another aspect of the QCDvacuum and the QCD phase transition. The QCD La-grangian contains quark mass parametersmq. The barevalues of up and down (i.e.,uand d) quark masses areonly a few MeV, accounting for an only small fractionof the nucleon mass composed ofu and d quarks. Thishuge discrepancy in the masses of quarks and baryons isexplained by spontaneous breaking ofchiral symmetry.
Its order parameter is the chiral condensate⟨¯qq⟩thatgives rise to the dynamical mass,Mq ∼ΛQCD ≫mq.
Almost all textbooks on quantum field theory affirmthat the divergent zero-point oscillation energy is harm-lessly discarded, but this common assertion is not validforQCDbecausethemassisnotaphysicalconstantbutis dynamically rooted in the QCD interactions. That is,the zero-point oscillation of quarks and antiquarks with7.2 QCD at high density 253Nc colors andNf flavors gives [54]Ezero = −2NfNc∫ Λ d3p(2π)3√p2 + M2q≃−NfNcΛ48π2[2 + ξ2 + O(ξ4)], (7.2.4)where Λ is a ultraviolet (UV) cutoff and the dimen-sionless parameter,ξ = Mq/Λ, is assumed to be small.
We see that the UV divergent term∝Λ4 is irrelevantto the dynamics, but we cannot drop another UV di-vergent term∼M2q Λ2 ∼Λ4ξ2. Because Mq is relatedto the chiral condensate in the QCD vacuum,⟨¯qq⟩, thevalue ofMq is dynamically determined to minimize thevacuum energy. The coefficient of the quadratic term,ξ2, is negative in Eq. (7.2.4), so thatEzero energeticallyfavors largerMq. It is the condensation energy,Econd,that competes the zero-point oscillation energy. Let uspostulate that gluon mediation induces a four-fermionicinteraction term∼λ¯qq¯qq in the low-energy Lagrangianwhere the mass dimension of the coupling constant,λ,is −2. Thus, a dimensionless coupling,ˆλ= Λ2λ, is use-ful, and the dimensional analysis hints at a relationMq = −2λ⟨¯qq⟩. (In QCD⟨¯qq⟩is known to take a neg-ative value.) Then, the condensation energy from theinteraction term is parametrically written asEcond = NfNcλ⟨¯qq⟩2 = NfNcM2q4λ = NfNcΛ44ˆλξ2 .
(7.2.5)Now,thebalancebetweentwoenergiesgivesaconditionfor the spontaneous generation ofMq ̸= 0; that is,ˆλ>2π2, as first derived by Nambu and Jona-Lasinio [54,2209]. For the four-fermionic interaction stronger thanthis threshold, the QCD vacuum accommodates a non-vanishing chiral condensate.
From the Dirac mass termmq ¯qq in the Lagrangianwe see that the mass and the chiral condensate are con-jugate to each other. It is thus evident that a nonzero⟨¯qq⟩is a source to generateMq even from a masslesstheory with mq = 0 . The massless Dirac fermions aresplit into the right-handed and the left-handed com-ponents and they do not communicate. Therefore, forthe theory with Nf flavors of massless quarks, a uni-tary rotation in flavor space is a symmetry in each ofthe right-handed and the left-handed sectors, i.e., thesystem enjoys the symmetry ofUR(Nf) ×UL(Nf). Ac-tually, the chiral condensate is decomposed as⟨¯qq⟩=⟨q†RqL + q†LqR⟩and it breaks the symmetry down to thevectorial one only,UV(Nf). Among these symmetries,conventionally,SUR(Nf)×SUL(Nf) is calledchiral sym-metry that is spontaneously broken so as to generatethe dynamical mass, Mq ∼ΛQCD, out from the baremass, mq ≪ΛQCD.

Wecanexpect,aselaboratedbelow,that ⟨¯qq⟩shouldmelt at high density and chiral symmetry should berestored then, which is commonly referred to as thechiral phase transition . It is the zero-point oscillationenergy (7.2.4) that favors the symmetry breaking, andits expression involves the phase-space integration. Atfinite quark chemical potentialµq which takes a largervalue with increasing quark number density, the Fermisphere is excluded from the phase-space integration dueto the Pauli exclusion principle. Accordingly the sym-metry breaking effect is diminished at finiteµq. There-fore, it is a reasonable educated guess that the chi-ral phase transition makes a boundary curve on thedensity-temperature plane just like the deconfinementphase transition, as already depicted in Fig.7.2.1.
Theexactrelationbetweenthedeconfinementphasetransition with an approximate order parameterLandthe chiral phase transition with another approximateorderparameter ⟨¯qq⟩isalongstandingprobleminQCD,and the satisfactory answer has not been found espe-cially at finite density. As a function ofmq, actually,the deconfinement phase transition is exact only in thelimit of mq →∞, while the chiral phase transition isexact only in the opposite limit ofmq →0. The lattice-QCD data at finiteT suggest that these two concep-tually distinct phase transitions at opposite limits beinterpolated by a single line for arbitrarymq [2210].
Figure 7.2.3 shows the Polyakov loop and the chiralcondensate as functions ofT, normalized by theT = 0values. We clearly notice that chiral symmetry is re-stored aroundTc ∼150 MeV, and at the same time thePolyakov loop starts increasing from nearly zero, indi-cating a simultaneous deconfinement crossover. Thus,the lattice-QCD simulation at finiteT has led us to a254 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONSChemical Potential μNuclear Superfluid BFig. 7.2.4A modern phase diagram of QCD with blurred de-confinement at higher density represented by the color grada-tion.

conclusion that two phase transitions of chiral restora-tion and deconfinement are somehow locked together.
Actually, the prototype phase diagram in Fig.7.2.1 as-sumes such tight locking of two transitions on the entireplane. However, as mentioned earlier, the barrier for theQCD string breaking would be eased by the density ef-fect and the deconfinement would be more and moreblurred at higher density, which implies a modernizedversion of the phase diagram as shown in Fig.7.2.4.
Here, as compared to the prototype in Fig.7.2.1, thereare three new ingredients added to Fig.7.2.4; namely,the color superconductivity, the quarkyonic regime, andthe QCD Critical Point (QCP). Moreover, Fig.7.2.4shows a new label, “sQGP” at highT and zero density,that refers to strongly correlated quark-gluon plasma.
We will address only high-density aspects of QCD inthissection,andforthephysicalinterpretationofsQGPand the experimental characterization, see the previoussection.
7.2.2 Quark MatterThere is no clear definition that distinguishes nuclearand quark matter. In one working definition, quarkmatter is a state of matter whose properties are reason-ably approximated by perturbative QCD (pQCD) cal-culations. The presence of quark matter in the neutronstar (NS) has been proposed by Collins and Perry [427]basedontheasymptoticfreedomathighbaryondensity(see also Ref. [2212] for a preceding hypothesis on quarkmatter). If the momentum scale associated with therunning strong coupling constant,αs, is characterizedby the baryon chemical potentialµB or the quark chem-ical potential µq = µB/3, asymptotically free quarksshould be liberated from hadrons as the density goesabove a certain threshold. In Ref. [427] the leading or-der (LO) contributions, i.e., thermodynamic quantitiesof free massless quarks, were considered:P(0) = Nc12π2Nf∑i=1µ4i . (7.2.6)The next-to-leading order (NLO) diagrams add correc-tions ofO(αs), i.e.,P(2) = −(αsπ) Ng16π2Nf∑i=1µ4i , (7.2.7)where the adjoint color factor,Ng = N2c −1, was intro-duced. The next-to-next leading order (N2LO) calcula-tions produce a logarithmic term withµq dependencein the argument. All the terms are not listed up here(see Ref. [2213] for the formulation and Ref. [2214] forthe QCD application); the logarithmic term looks likeP(4) = +(αsπ)2 Ngβ064π2Nf∑i=1µ4i ln µ2iµ20+ (non-log terms),(7.2.8)where β0 = (11Nc −2Nf)/3. Non-logarithmic terms areomitted. Even if αs is sufficiently small, αs ln(µ2i/µ20)may become large, and then the perturbative expansionbreaks down. A remedy for this problem of the singu-lar logarithm is the resummation over the leading-logterms. For simplicity let us assume that all the quarkchemical potentials are identical. (More generally onecan introduce a flavor averaged value of the chemicalpotential.) Actually, it is easy to confirm that, ifαs isupgraded to the running one, i.e.,αs(µq)π = αsπ[1 +(αsπ)β04 ln(µ2q/µ20)]−1, (7.2.9)an expansion of Eq. (7.2.7) can reproduce Eq. (7.2.8).
In other words, such dangerous logarithmic terms areabsorbed into the density-dependent running coupling,αs(µq) (see Ref. [2214] for more details). In this waythe perturbative calculation is justified at high enoughdensity.
From this construction of the running coupling con-stant, one can easily imagine that the resummation isnot free from an arbitrary choice of irrelevant constants.
Instead ofln(µ2q/µ20), one could try to makea resumma-tion ofln(µ2q/µ20)+C = ln(µ2q/µ21)with µ21 = µ20e−C. Inprinciple, an optimal choice ofC could exist to reducehigher-order corrections. If C is close to the optimalpoint,theresultsareexpectedtobeflatagainstchangesof C, and it is customary to check the stability of theresults by changingX of αs(Xµq). Here, the logarith-mic term inαs(Xµq) takes the form ofln(X2µ2q/Λ2MS)in the MS scheme [2215]. It is then found that such7.2 QCD at high density 255variation ofX = 1 ∼4 leads to huge uncertainty un-less µq becomes unphysically large. This is sometimesreferred to as the slow-convergence problem. The nextcorrection, i.e., the N3LO contribution is expected tostabilize the results better, and indeed the soft N3LOpart has been shown to cure the slow-convergence prob-lem partially [2216, 2217].
7.2.3 Color-Superconducting PhasesThe pQCD calculation is not capable of describing dy-namical generation of ⟨¯qq⟩, which is apparently con-sistent with melting chiral condensate at high density.
However, even at high density, high enough to validatepQCD, the chiral condensate is not simply gone.
Quarks carry a fundamental charge in color SU(3),and so two charges of a pair of quarks (i.e., a diquark)connected by one-gluon exchange are coupled via(ta)ij(ta)kl= −Nc + 14Nc(δijδkl −δilδkj) + Nc −14Nc(δijδkl+ δilδkj)(7.2.10)corresponding to3⊗3 = ¯3⊕6 in the group theoreticallanguage. Interestingly, as implied from the sign of eachterm in the above decomposition, the inter-quark inter-action in the¯3 channel is attractive, while the6 channelinteraction is repulsive. This attractive nature is intu-itively understood as follows: Suppose that two quarksare infinitely separate (in the deconfined phase), thenthe total field energy is just twice of the field energyassociated with a single quark. If two quarks approachand make a composite of¯3, the total field energy is thesame as that of a single quark, that is, a half of theoriginal total energy. So, the energy decreases as twoquarks touch. Consequently two quarks in the¯3 chan-nel should feel an attractive force to minimize the totalenergy.
Themostfavoreddiquarkchanneliscoloranti-triplet(anti-symmetric) and spin singlet (anti-symmetric) andthus the flavor must be anti-symmetric. The diquarksgenerally carry two color indices and two flavor indices,but the diquark matrix in the most favored color-flavorchannel simplifies toΦiα = ϵijkϵαβγ qTjβCγ5qkγ . (7.2.11)Here, C = iγ0γ2 is the charge conjugation matrix nec-essary to make the diquark a Lorentz scalar. The Latinand the Greek letters represent the indices in flavor andcolor space, respectively.
In the three-flavor symmetric limit withmu = md =ms, the flavor rotation as well as the color rotation is asymmetry of the system. Then, it is possible to choosethe flavor and the color bases to diagonalizeΦiα. With-out loss of generality we can parametrize the diquarkcondensate as⟨Φiα⟩= δiα∆i. (7.2.12)Under the identification of i = 1 , α = 1 for up (u)and red (r), i = 2 , α = 2 for down (d) and green(g), and i = 3 , α = 3 for strange (s) and blue (b),for example, ∆1 involves pairings of gd-bs and gs-bdquarks. A state of quark matter with∆1 ̸= 0 , ∆2 ̸= 0 ,and ∆3 ̸= 0 is known as the color-flavor locking (CFL)phase. The CFL phase is considered to be the groundstateaslongasthestrangequarkmassisignored.Intheopposite limit of infinitely heavy strange quark mass,we can regard quark matter as composed from onlylight flavors. In this case only∆3 (involving ru-gd andrd-gu quark pairings) can take a nonzero value, while∆1 = ∆2 = 0 due to suppression of strange quarks.
Such a state of∆1 = ∆2 = 0 and ∆3 ̸= 0 is called thetwo-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) phase.
Which symmetry should spontaneously be brokenby the diquark condensate is a nontrivial question. Letus first consider the 2SC phase. We note that the lo-cal gauge symmetry is never broken. Then, the baryonUV(1) symmetry is not broken in the 2SC phase sinceits rotation on ∆3 can be always canceled by unbro-ken electromagnetic transformation. The same argu-ment concludes that flavor (chiral) symmetry is notbroken, either. Therefore, in the 2SC phase, all globalsymmetries are unbroken, only modified with a mix-ture of local symmetry. One might think that color-superconducting phases assume deconfined quark mat-ter, but as shown in Ref. [2218], the low-energy physicsin the 2SC phase is governed by ungapped gluons in theunbroken SU(2) sector and color confinement persists.
Theoretically speaking, there is no gauge-invariant or-der parameter to define the 2SC phase.
In reality, however, the 2SC phase is anyway takenoverbytheCFLphaseathighdensitywherethestrangequark mass is negligible. TheNf = 3 world is drasticallydifferent from the 2SC phase. TheUV(1) symmetry canno longer be restored by the electromagnetic symme-try because∆1 and ∆2,3 are differently charged. Thus,the CFL phase has a superfluid, and a vortex configu-ration is topologically stabilized. Also, chiral symmetryis spontaneously broken. We note that the diquark con-densate has both the left-handed and the right-handedcomponents; that is,⟨qq⟩= ⟨qRqR⟩+ ⟨qLqL⟩̸= 0 , and⟨qR,LqR,L⟩breaks SUR,L(3). The vectorial rotation inflavor space can still be canceled by unbroken color ro-tation, so the symmetry breaking pattern in the CFL256 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONSphase turns out to be:SUR(3)×SUL(3) →SUV(3). In-terestingly, this is identical to the symmetry breakingin the hadronic phase. Actually the gauge-invariant or-der parameter of the CFL phase is,⟨(¯q¯q)(qq)⟩∼⟨ (¯qq)2⟩that induces⟨¯qq⟩̸= 0 unless the anomalousUA(1) is re-stored. The observation of exactly the same symmetryproperties has led to a conjecture of continuity betweenthehadronicphase(i.e.,theconfinedphase)withsuper-fluidityandtheCFLphase(i.e.,theHiggsphase)[ 2219].
We can develop an intuitive understanding of thecontinuity. In the case of electron superconductivity,there is no gauge-invariant order parameter, and onemight think that the theoretical characterization is asproblematic. In this case, however, the solution has al-ready been known. Because the Cooper pairs have twicethe elementary charge, they cannot completely screen asingle elementary charge. This would lead to an emer-gentZ2 symmetry and the superconducting state is un-ambiguously defined by the symmetry.
This argument makes it clear why the CFL phase isso special. As mentioned earlier, the most favored di-quark is found in the color triplet (and the anti-triplet)channel made from 3 ⊗3 →¯3. So, the Cooper pairs(i.e, the diquarks) are charged just like the fundamen-tal (anti-)charge. Thus, a fundamental charge can bescreened by Cooper pairs and the definition of the CFLphase is obscured, which underlies the continuity sce-nariobetweenhypernuclearmatterandCFLquarkmat-ter.
The continuity scenario cannot be applied to the2SC phase as it is, but it was pointed out in Ref. [2220]that the NS environment can realize continuity withinthe two-flavor sector only. The idea is that the electricneutrality requires twice mored-quarks thanu-quarks,and freed-quarks (not paired withu-quarks) may forma condensate of⟨dd⟩. In this exotic phase that may becalled the 2SC+d phase, the electromagnetic rotationcannot cancel rotations in∆3 and ⟨dd⟩simultaneously,and so it is a superfluid withUV(1) breaking, and also,it spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry. In this way,as illustrated in Fig.7.2.5, the continuity can be formu-lated.
Recently, the quark-hadron continuity scenario isencountering a fatal challenge. As mentioned, the emer-gent Z2 symmetry characterizes ordinary electron su-perconductivity, and to see it mathematically, a Wilsonloop as a symmetry generator is acted on a magneticvortex operator. The magnetic flux in a superconduct-ing cylinder is quantized in units not of2πℏc/e but ofπℏc/e due to doubly charged Cooper pairs. The sym-metry operation with the Wilson loop, hence, resultsin aZ2 phase. The same exercise in the CFL phase re-places the magnetic vortex with the non-Abelian CFLNeutron superfluid Color superconductord udud du ddd udu dddudnB∼ n0 ∼ 5 n0 ∼ 10 n0Fig. 7.2.5An illustration of the two-flavor continuity scenariobetween nuclear matter and 2SC+d quark matter in the NSenvironment inβ equilibrium.

vortex [2221] that carries both the global phase as wellas the chromo-magnetic flux. From the explicit expres-sion of the non-Abelian CFL vortex, it has been shownin Ref. [2222] that a Z3 symmetry emerges (see alsoRef. [2223] for more mathematical discussions). The ha-dronic phase presumably confines any color degrees offreedom,anditisanaturalanticipation(butnotprovenyet) that thisZ3 symmetry operation is merely trivialin the confined phase. If so, the spontaneous breakingof emergentZ3 symmetry should result in a phase tran-sition from nuclear to quark matter. It is not yet set-tled theoretically whether a phase transition really sep-arates nuclear and quark matter. The symmetry argu-ments are convincing, but the calculations are feasibleonly at high enough density,not at intermediatedensitywhere a transitional change may occur. As we will arguelater, astrophysical observations constrain the strengthof first-order phase transition for the neutron-rich NSmatter, and for the moment it disfavors the first-orderphase transition.
7.2.4 Quarkyonic RegimeIn the large-Nc limit the duality between nuclear andquarkmatterhasbeenrecognizedbyMcLerranandPis-arski [2224] and they named the dual regime of matterQuarkyonic Matter after a combination of “quark” and“baryonic”. It should be noted that Quarkyonic Matteris not a novel phase of matter but it refers to a regimein which the duality is manifested.
The conjectured duality is based on the large-Nccounting of the pressure. Along the temperature axisat zero baryon density, the pressure jumps fromO(1)in the confined phase toO(N2c ) in the deconfined glu-onic phase, which defines a first-order phase transitioneven with dynamical quarks. Then, along the axis ofthe baryon/quark chemical potential at zero tempera-ture, one might also think of a phase transition fromO(1) in confined nuclear matter to O(Nc) in decon-finedquarkmatter.Thisnaïveordercountingimplicitlyneglects the contribution from interactions that could7.2 QCD at high density 257N N¼Fig. 7.2.6 A quark description of two-bodyNN interaction.
be dropped in the dilute/dense limits, but not in theintermediate density region. Actually, in the large-Nclimit, the amplitude of meson scattering is suppressedso that mesons can be regarded as non-interacting par-ticles, while baryons interact strongly. It is immedi-ately understood why the strength of baryon interac-tion scales as O(Nc). The one pion exchange processfor the two-body nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction canbe viewed microscopically as a quark hopping from oneto the other baryon as shown in a schematic picturein Fig. 7.2.6. There areN2c combinations of quark ex-changes, among which color singlets are ofO(Nc). Incontrast,the n-pointinteractionverticesofmesonsscaleas O(N1−n/2c ) that goes to zero asNc →∞ for n≥3.
All the multi-body interactions of nucleons turn out toscale as O(Nc) which coincides with the scaling prop-erty peculiar to quark matter. In this way, in Quarky-onic Regime, the system is still in the confined phaseand the relevant degrees of freedom are baryons, butthe pressure is sensitive to quark degrees of freedomthrough inter-baryonic interactions.
Now, we see that the deconfinement phenomenoninduced by baryons at high density is far more non-trivial than the high temperature situation dominatedby mesons. For weakly interacting mesons the onset ofdeconfinement can be approximated as an overlap ofwavefunctions, that agrees with a picture of site per-colation. For baryons, however, the onset of deconfine-ment would be rather located at the density where theNN, NNN , and arbitrary multi-body interactions be-come comparably strong, building a connected networkof interacting bonds. In the language of percolation,hence, it would not be the site percolation but the bondpercolation that is appropriate for high-density decon-finement. It has also been speculated that the decon-finement onset could be delayed toward higher densitybyquantumfluctuationsassuggestedinaquantumper-colation picture [2225].
In Quarkyonc Regime the state of matter is notsimply quark-like nor baryon-like, but something thatshares both features. It is unlikely that there is anysharp deconfinement boundary in the phase diagram asdrawn in the prototype in Fig.7.2.1. This is why de-confinement is represented by smooth gradation overQuarkyonic Regime in Fig.7.2.4. It is quite suggestivethat both the CFL phase and Quarkyonic Regime favorsmooth continuity between nuclear and quark matterin parallel, even though the diquark condensate is sup-pressed in the large-Nc limit and color-superconductingmatter and Quarkyonic Matter seem not to coexist.
7.2.5 Critical Point vs. Inhomogeneous StatesSo far, we have focused on deconfinement, and we shallnow turn to the chiral phase transition at finite den-sity. It has been established that the chiral phase tran-sition at physical quark masses is a smooth crossoverif the chiral restoration is induced by the tempera-ture effect [2226]. Most chiral models predict that, asthe baryon density increases, the behavior of the chi-ral condensate as a function of increasingT becomessteeper. Eventually, in some chiral models, the chiralrestoration occurs with a discontinuous jump in thechiral condensate, and the separation point betweenthe smooth crossover and the first-order phase tran-sition corresponds to the exact second-order criticalpoint,whichiscommonlycalledtheQCDCriticalPoint(QCP). It is sometimes referred to as the critical endpoint(CEP)ofQCDmatteraswell.ThepresenceoftheQCP was first recognized in the Nambu–Jona-Lasiniomodel by Asakawa, Yazaki [2227], and in a QCD-likemodel by Barducci, Casalbuoni, De Crutis, Gatto, Pet-tini [2228], independently. For a comprehensive reviewon the order of chiral restoration at the early stage, seeRef. [2229].
In the language of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, thegrand potential has an expansion,Ω = α22 M2 + α44 M4 + α66 M6 + O(M8) , (7.2.13)with respect to an order parameterM ∼⟨¯qq⟩(propor-tional to the constituent quark mass). For simplicitythe bare quark mass effect that induces a symmetry-breaking term ∝M is dropped. The coefficients, αi,are functions ofT and µB. Ifα2 changes its sign whileα4 > 0 is kept, a second-order phase transition is de-rived. Ifα2 = 0 and α4 changes its sign forα6 > 0, atricritical point appears.
Interestingly, the QCP has nothing to do with theoriginal chiral symmetry of QCD, and the universalityclass belongs to the same as the three-dimensional Isingmodel. Only when the bare quark mass is vanishing,as mentioned above, the QCP is located on the chiralphase transition, which exhibits tricriticality. At finitebare quark mass that explicitly breaks chiral symme-try, the QCP is identified as theZ2 liquid-gas transitionwhose order parameter is the density, i.e., a conserved258 7 QCD UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONSquantity coupled with the energy-momentum tensor,resultinginthedynamicaluniversalityclassofthemodelH [2230].
The QCP can be an unambiguous landmark, if ex-perimentally confirmed, on the QCD phase diagram. Itis,however,quitenontrivialwhatplaysaroleofasigna-ture. The most well-investigated quantity in the searchfor the QCP is the fluctuation observable. Because thecorrelation functions scale with the correlation lengthξ, that ideally diverges near the critical point but doesnot in reality due to the critical slowing down, one canmake a robust prediction for the critical behavior char-acterized by ξ to the power of critical exponent. Al-though the time evolution away from the QCP maywash out the critical signature, the fluctuation of theconserved quantities such as the baryon number, theelectric charge, and the strangeness (within the timescale of the strong interaction) could retain a trace ofcriticality if its value is frozen inside the critical region.
This means that, to probe the QCP in a heavy-ion colli-sion experiment, the created hot and dense matter mustcool down along the trajectory hitting the critical re-gion of the QCP, and the chemical freezeout (that fixesthe ratio of the particle species) must be located suffi-ciently near the QCP. Such requirements may hold ormay not.
There is no reliable QCD-based prediction for thelocation of the QCP due to the sign problem, but thevirtue of the QCP search is that the critical theoryprovides us with unique theoretical prediction once itslocation on the phase diagram is experimentally con-strained. We have already learnt a lot about fluctu-ations from nearly zero baryon density (at high col-lision energy √sNN ≳ 100 GeV) to high density (at√sNN ∼ 3 GeV) from the heavy-ion collision experi-ments. See discussions in the previous section and thefigure to show the data ofκ4/κ2. For a review includ-ing related topics, especially the kurtosis (fourth or-der fluctuation of the proton number) and the skewness(third order fluctuation), see Ref. [2231] and referencestherein.
It is also mentioned that constructing an effectivedescriptionoflow-energydynamicsnearthecriticalpointisanintriguingtheoreticalchallenge.Typicallythetimeevolution of locally equilibrated matter is governed byundampedzeromodesassociatedwithconservationlaws,which constitutes the hydrodynamic description basedon the derivative expansion. In the vicinity of the crit-ical point, the critical slowing down breaks the clearscale separation. Then, the correlation of the diffusivemode, that is the slowest one, should be coupled in thehydrodynamic equations, and such a generalized frame-work – called the “Hydro+” – has been proposed [2232].

One subtlety remains. The grand potential,Ω, canbe generally expressed as a functional of the order pa-rameter, which is denoted byM(x) here. If the spa-tial variation is smaller than other scales, the deriva-tive expansion makes sense and the spatial profile ofM(x) is optimized to minimize the energy locally. Itwas Nickel [2233] who first recognized that in a typicalchiral model in the mean-field approximation the localenergy takes the following structured form:Ω = α22 M(x)2 + α44[M(x)4 + (∇M(x))2]+ α66[M(x)6 + 5(∇M(x))2M(x)2 + 12(∆M(x))2].
(7.2.14)This is a striking result. At the tricritical point (andnear the QCP also)α4 should change its sign. Forα4 <0, the coefficient of the first derivative correction turnsout to be negative too, which means that∇M(x) ̸= 0would lower the local energy. Therefore, the above formof the expanded energy indicates that the ground stateshould be spatially inhomogeneous.
The onset of inhomogeneity is called the Lifshitzpoint and Nickel’s calculation was the first clarificationfor an explicit relation between the QCP and the Lif-shitz point, though there were preceding works to hintatthepossibilityofinhomogeneousgroundstates[ 2234].
Whether the QCP and the Lifshitz point exactly coin-cide or not depends on the model choice and the ap-proximation, and in more realistic model studies theQCP is overridden by the inhomogeneous states (seeRef. [2235] for a comprehensive review). Interestingly,such an inhomogeneous state is favored also in Quarky-onic Regime; the large-Nc limit justifies an approxima-tion of nuclear matter by a Skyrme crystal that in-evitably gives rise to inhomogeneous chiral condensate.
Therefore, another view of the QCD phase diagrammay look like Fig. 7.2.7 on which the QCP is taken7.2 QCD at high density 259over by an approximate triple point where the hadronicphase,thequark-gluonplasma,andQuarkyonicRegime(or the inhomogeneous state) meet [2207]. Once thelarge-Nc approximation is relaxed, however, the ther-mal fluctuations of phonons and pions should be takeninto account. It is known by now that inhomogeneouscondensates are unstable and the quasi-long-range or-der (i.e., not exponential but algebraic decay of the or-der parameter correlation) could survive there [2236,2237]. In contrast to the QCP on Fig. 7.2.4, it is ademanding question what can be an experimental sig-nature to detect Quarkyonic Regime (or the quasi-long-rangeorder)ifthegenuinephasediagramislikeFig. 7.2.7.
Even without inhomogeneous condensates, for exam-ple for the theory proposal, the order parameter modescould be modified nontrivially to have a damped disper-sion relation similar to the roton, which was discussedas a candidate for the observable signature [2238].
7.2.6 Astrophysical ConstraintsFigure 7.2.7 looks like one variant of conjectured phasediagrams, but a special realization of dense matter inaccord to Fig. 7.2.7 is known. That is, the state ofdense matter in deep cores of a neutron star (NS) sat-isfies the β equilibrium condition and contains moreneutrons than protons due to the Coulomb interaction.
This makes a sharp contrast to the heavy-ion collisionwhose time scale is shorter than the weak interaction,and flavor changing processes are negligible. It is im-portant to note that the isospin contents would signifi-cantlyaffectthephasestructureofQCDmatter.Awell-known example is that the first-order liquid-gas phasetransition of symmetric nuclear matter in Fig. 7.2.4does not exist any more in the NS matter; that is,pure neutron matter is not a self-bound fermionic sys-tem unlike symmetric nuclear matter. Then, it wouldbe conceivable that the β equilibrium condition sim-plifies the phase diagram from the conventional one asin Fig. 7.2.4 into a smoother shape without any solidphase boundary as in Fig.7.2.7.
In fact, as we saw already before, the quark-hadroncontinuity scenario of the color-superconducting phaseand the large-Nc Quarkyonic Regime supports a pic-ture of smooth crossover from nuclear to quark matter.
Here, we discuss astrophysical constraints about thephase transition of QCD matter. The internal struc-ture of the NS follows from the hydrostatic condition(called the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation) be-tween the inward gravitational force and the outwardpressure gradient. To this end, the calculation of thepressure gradient needs the relation of the pressure asa function of the baryon density, i.e.,p = p(ρ), or asa function of the energy density, p = p(ε), which isreferred to as the equation of state (EOS).
There is no first-principles derivation of the EOSexcept for the zero-density and the high-density limitsand the EOS is the most crucial source of uncertaintyin NS phenomenology. For a given ε, the EOS withlarger p(and smallerp) is called “stiff” (and “soft”, re-spectively). Generally speaking, stiffer EOSs can sup-port heavier NSs, and so the heaviest NS can give usthe information about the EOS stiffness. If an assumedmodel cannot predict a stiff EOS enough to explain theexperimentally confirmed largest NS mass, this modelis falsified. In the presence of the first-order phase tran-sition, p= p(ε) should have a plateau, i.e., a window ofε with a constantp, in the mixed-phase region, whichgenerally makes the EOS softer.
In 2010 the mass measurement in a binary system(anNSandawhitedwarf)bymeansoftheShapirotimedelay established the existence of a two-solar-mass NS(PSR J1614-2230 [2239]). Later, similar massive NSs(PSR J0348+0432 [2240] and PSR J0740+6620 [2241])have been discovered. These observations are extremelyuseful to make strict constraints and to exclude someof soft EOSs. In particular, the first-order phase tran-sition is disfavored; it should be weak if the first-orderphase transition takes place at moderate density reach-able in the NS environment, or the first-order phasetransition can occur only at large density beyond theNS region [2242]. In principle, a very rapid stiffeningbefore/after the first-order phase transition could alsoyield an EOS that supports the massive NSs, but jus-tification of the underlying mechanism needs furtherinvestigations. Actually, theab initio estimates basedon the chiral effective theory (χEFT) and the pQCDsuggest that the nuclear EOS near the saturation den-sity n0 and quark EOS for high density≳ 5n0 are bothsofter than empirically adopted EOSs, and the stiffen-ing should occur around1.5-1.8 times n0 [2243].
It is quite suggestive that such behavior of rapidstiffening from a low-density soft EOS is inferred fromthe experimental data, irrespective of any theoreticalconjecture. The distribution of masses and radii of theobserved NSs can be analyzed by probabilistic meth-ods and the preferred EOS can be constructed fromthe observational data only. Figure7.2.8 shows a spe-cific combination of the EOS, i.e.,1/3 −p/ε, as a func-tion of dimensionless energy density ε/ε0 with ε0 =150 MeV/fm3, that approaches zero in the conformallimit at high density.
