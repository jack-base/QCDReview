and experimental data from BaBar and Belle, leavingVub as a parameter. Such a fit allows experimental in-formation onq2-dependence to constrain the lattice re-sults.

The transitionsb→c have also shown a persistenttension between inclusive and exclusive results. Herethe preferred exclusive method is to useB →D∗ decay.
Although a pseudoscalar to vector transition is morecomplicated, with 4 form factors, only the axial vec-tor A1 form factor contributes atq2max. Lattice QCDtherefore initially concentrated on this point [706, 707].
Now it has become clear that theq2-dependence of thedifferential rate must be understood from the latticeQCD side and form factors have been calculated by theFermilab Lattice/MILC collaboration [708] that covermoreofthe q2 rangeusingtheirimproved-Wilsonactionfor bothband c. This does not resolve the inclusive/ex-clusive Vcb tension but points the way to improved fu-ture analyses.
Recent B form factors have been calculated usingrelativistic formalisms that can make use of nonpertur-bative current normalisation techniques discussed forEqs 4.7.14 and 4.7.15. They obtain results for multipleheavy quark masses and lattice spacings and fit to ob-tain results forB mesons in the continuum limit in asimilar way to that for decay constants in Fig.4.7.2.
Calculations include HPQCD’s form factors forBs →Ds [709], Bs →D∗s [710] andB →K [703] using HISQquarks and JLQCD’s form factors for B → π usingdomain-wall quarks [711]. This is likely to be the wayforward for the future.
It is important to remember that QCD provides asmooth connection between different form factors as wechange the mass for one or other of the participatingquarks. In this way lattice QCD can provide ‘a big pic-ture’ for form factors. Fig.4.7.9 shows this connectionfor different spectator (not part of the weak current)quarks for the b →s transition. It also shows resultsfor H →K decay where H is a meson containing aheavy quark with mass varying fromc to b [703].
Future calculations will improveB form factor un-certaintiestothe1%level[ 712]fortheincreaseddatasetsplanned from LHC and Belle II. New developments in-clude techniques for inclusive B decays [713] and forhandling final-state mesons that decay strongly (e.g.
for B →K∗ℓν analysis) [554]. An important focus willbe improving lattice calculations needed to understand‘B anomalies’ seen, for example in ratios of branchingfractions to different flavours of leptons and differentialrates for flavour-changing neutral currentb→stransi-tions (e.g.B →Kℓ+ℓ−) that proceed through loops inthe SM.
ThelatticeQCDcalculationofformfactorsforweakdecays of baryons is still in its infancy, because of theextra challenges provided by the poorer signal-noise.
The nucleon axial coupling,gA, has been a particularfocus of attention and is discussed in Sec.4.6. A notablesuccess has been the use of lattice QCD form factorsfor Λb →Λc and Λb →Λ [714] to determineVub/Vcbby LHCb [715]. This is clearly a developing area for thefuture.
5 Approximate QCDConveners:Stan Brodsky and F ranz GrossThe next two sections of this volume discus theoreticalways to model QCD. At the heart of all modern modelsare quarks, treated as elementary particles that interactboth with single gluons and with a complex QCD vac-uum containing condensates. Since numerical LatticeGauge calculations discussed in the previous section arethe only way known to treat these interactions exactly,all of these analytical methods are approximations.
Starting from a description of quarks (Sec. 5.1) andnew virtual colored degrees of freedom multiple quark5.1 Quark models 109states could occupy at short distances (hidden colorstates discussed in Sec. 5.2), the section moves on toa discussion of the Bethe Salpeter (BS) and DysonSchwinger(DS)equations(Sec.5.3),wherequark-gluoninteractions are treated microscopically, much as pion-nucleon interactions were described in an earlier era.
Here the multiple interactions make it impossible totreat them all systematically, and the equations mustbetruncated,introducingapproximationswithanaccu-racy that is sometimes hard to estimate. Light front co-ordinates are the preferred way to describe multi-quarksystems, and Sec. 5.4 describes methods for expandingmulti-quark quark wave functions in a light front basisthat avoids some of the issues with the microscopic de-scription, but also requires truncations of the expansionto a finite number of basis functions.
These methods handle the confinement of quarksin different ways with very different assumptions. InSec. 5.5, recent developments based on superconformalquantum mechanics, light-front quantization, and itsholographic embedding in a higher dimension classi-cal gravity theory, known as AdS/QCD, have led tonew analytic insights into the nonperturbative struc-ture and dynamics of hadrons in physical spacetime,such as color confinement and chiral symmetry break-ing. This contribution is followed by a short discussion(Sec. 5.6) of the model dependence of predictions of thebehavior of the strong fine structure constant,αs(Q2)at small Q, where it becomes large. This discussioncomplements and completes the discussions ofαs(Q2)in Sec. 3. Next, the interesting features that can bedrawn from the study of QCD with a large number ofcolors, and the solvable ’t Hooft model, are reviewed inSec. 5.7.
The next three contributions in this section dis-cuss approximations that treat specific issues: the useof sum rules based on the operator product expansion(OPE) to explain properties of mesons and other phys-ical quantities (Sec. 5.8); approximations that work forhigh energy reactions which can be factorized into re-action specific high energy parts that can be computedperturbatively and low energy, reaction independentparts expressed in terms of unknown functions that areextracted from many experiments (Sec. 5.9); and thepower counting rules that describe the behavior of ex-clusive processes at high energy (Se. 5.10).
The section concludes with Sec. 5.11 where a theo-retical discussion of the complexity of the QCD vacuumneeded to understand confinement and chiral symmetrybreakingispresented.Thisdiscussioniscomplementaryto the Lattice discussion of the same topic, Sec. 4.3.
Section 5 covers a very wide range of topics, butas you will see from what follows, is only part of thetheoretical tool box developed to ”solve” a theory basedon a Lagrangian that can be written in one line!5.1 Quark modelsEric Swanson“It is more important to have the right degreesof freedom moving at the wrong speed, than thewrong degrees of freedom moving at the rightspeed.”— Gabriel Karl, as frequently quoted by NathanIsgur.
5.1.1 Early Quark ModelsThe phrase “quark model” originally meant somethinglike the “quark idea”, referring to the introduction ofquarks as the elements of the fundamental representa-tion ofSUF(3) by Gell-Mann and Zweig in 1964 [716–718]. Gell-Mann initially avoided attributing physicalreality to the quark concept, and it was others, such asDalitz [719], Becchi, Morpugo [720], Rubinstein, Scheck[721], and Lipkin [722] who developed the idea into aviable and predictive model in the sense we use now.
That this was not a simple task is illustrated by a fa-mous line from Kokkedee’s review of the quark model,“The quark model should ... not be taken for more thanit is, namely, the tentative and simplistic expression ofan as yet obscure dynamics underlying the hadronicworld.”[723]Kokkedee’s pessimism was not misplaced. The in-ability to observe free quarks was originally explainedby assuming that they had very high masses. The ex-istence of relatively light hadrons then implied thatthe interquark binding force was “ultra-strong”, whichin turn requires relativistic and nonperturbative tech-niques. These technical problems were further exacer-bated by the “statistics problem”, wherein bound statesof fermions must be antisymmetric. Thus, for example,the ∆++ requires an antisymmetric spatial wavefunc-tion, in contrast with expectations for a low lying state.
No satisfactory solution to the problem was found, inspite of the great contortions theorists invented.
Nevertheless, a few determined individuals persistedwith the notion that quarks are “real”. Early computa-tions drew from long tradition in nuclear physics[720,724, 725] and tended to focus on electroweak transi-tions since the couplings are weak and the effects ofunknown spatial wavefunctions can be ignored (in mag-netic dipole transitions) or simply modelled (in electricdipole transitions). These computations typically as-sumednonrelativisticdynamics,factorizedspatialwave-functions, and electroweak currents coupling directly to110 5 APPROXIMATE QCDquarks. The state of the art was formalized in a clas-sic paper from 1967 by van Royen and Weisskopf, whichplaced the topic on firm footing (even though the quarkmodel problems remained unresolved)[726]. By 1969,Copely, Karl, and Obryk had brought the quark modelto a high level of predictiveness, introducing explicitsimple harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and a “con-stituent” quark mass of roughly one third the protonmass, in line with its modern value[727].
5.1.2 QCD-improved Quark ModelsIt is no surprise that the advent of QCD revolution-ized the conceptualization and application of the quarkmodel, releasing a flood of research. QCD, of course,is the theory of hadrons; thus the quark model was nolonger the first and final word for hadronic properties,anditquicklyevolvedintoitscurrentroleasacomputa-tionally feasible model for QCD in the strong couplingregime.
Already by 1975 (November 1974), Appelquist andPolitzer famously applied QCD to the R ratio (pro-portional to the cross section fore+e− to hadrons) andnotedthatladderexchangesofgluonsshouldgiveriseto“orthocharmonium” (theJ/ψ) and “paracharmonium”(the ηc) states[74]. This was the time of the “Novem-ber revolution” described in Sec.2.1 above. These no-tions were greatly expanded by De Rujula, Georgi, andGlashow, who argued that one gluon exchange shoulddominate the short distance quark interaction and thatit explained a wealth of experimental data, concludingthat “The naive quark model, supplemented by colorgauge theory, asymptotic freedom, and infrared slav-ery, is turning out to be not so naive, and more thanjust a model.”[728]. In fact the results were successfulenough that the authors initiatedand ended the fieldin the same paper, declaring,Notuntilmanyofthesepredictedcharmedstatesare discovered and measured can the subject ofhadron spectroscopy join its distinguished col-leagues,atomicandnuclearspectroscopy,assub-jects certainly worthy of continued study, butunderstood (at some level) in principle.
Needless to say, such proclamations seem premature tomodern eyes!Amongst the first to join the fray were Isgur andKarl, who wrote a complete model Hamiltonian forbaryons,assumingnonrelativisticdynamics,aquadraticconfinementpotential,andshortdistancespin-dependenceas given by one gluon exchange[729]. (For a full discus-sion of baryon quark models, see Sec.9.1) The resultingreasonably complete description of the low lying baryonspectrum and its properties caused a sensation, as itwas realized that comprehensive and quantitative com-putations of hadronic properties were possible. How-ever, there was a price to be paid: the good results wereobtainedonlyuponneglectingthespin-orbitinteractionarising from one gluon exchange. It is, of course, diffi-cult to argue in favor of one aspect of perturbative QCDwhile neglecting another! By way of defense, Isgur andKarlnotedthattheconfinementinteractionshouldcon-tribute Thomas precession spin-orbit interactions, eventhough it is spin-independent, and that the long rangespin-orbit interaction tends to cancel that due to onegluon exchange.
The issue of the spin-dependence of the long range(confinement) interaction reappeared in a nearly con-temporary and seemingly disconnected area. At issuewasthe Diracstructure ofa (presumed)relativistic longrange two-body interaction for quarks,1/2∫∫J(x)K(x−y)J(y),where the current is written asJ = ¯ψΓψ, ψ is a quarkfield, and Γ is a four-by-four Dirac matrix. In 1978,Schnitzer realized that the masses of several newly dis-covered charmonia and bottomonia permitted settlingthe issue in favor of a scalar (Γ = 1) confinement inter-action[730, 731].
Of course assuming that the interaction betweenquarks is specified by a current-current operator yieldsmorethanspin-dependence–italsogivestheamplitudefor quark pair creation, and therefore opens the field ofstrong hadronic transitions to investigation. (Such in-vestigationsactuallydatetothebeginningsofthequarkmodel, starting with Micu’s hypothesis that quark pairsare produced in a spin triplet, angular momentum one,state[732, 733].)In 1978, Eichtenet al. produced the most famousversion of such a model, the “Cornell model” (first in-troduced in 1975), in an ambitious attempt to under-stand the properties of charmonia, including their cou-pling to the open charm continuum[734]. Pragmatismforced compromise: the Cornell group had to assume acolor density current to obtain agreement with the, bynow well-established, one gluon exchange short rangestructure of the quark interaction, and in disagreementwith the decay model of Micu (which is admittedly aguess)andSchnitzer’sscalarconfinement.Nevertheless,the model is well-constrained and does admirably wellin predicting a wealth of charmonium properties.
By 1985 the field had progressed enough that com-prehensive models capable of describing all mesons andbaryons were being attempted. The most famous ofthese is that due to Godfrey and Isgur (mesons) and5.1 Quark models 111Capstick and Isgur (baryons)[735, 736]. The model hasmuch in common with earlier ones such as Ref. [737].
The model assumes relativistic quark kinematics, thefull one gluon exchange short range interaction, and ascalar confinement interaction (including its spin-orbitrelativistic correction). All interactions were convolutedover a Gaussian to ameliorate the strength of the shortrange terms (which are not legal operators in quantummechanics).
Amodeloftherunningstrongcouplingwasusedbe-causethereisstrongevidencethatweakerspin-dependentinteractions are required for heavier quarks. The possi-bility of quark annihilation in isoscalar channels was al-lowedbyincludingaphenomenologicalterm.Themodelwas “relativized” by including factors of(m/E)ν, whereν is a model parameter, in various matrix elements.
Finally, additional factors of meson and quark masswere introduced to certain rates to bring their forminto alignment with low energy theorems. The result-ing masses, strong decays, and electroweak transitionshave served as a benchmark in hadronic physics overthe intervening 37 years.
5.1.3 Bag ModelsThe advent of QCD raised the possibility of invent-ing field-theoretic models of hadrons. The opportunitywas seized first by Ken Johnson, who drew an analogyto bubble nucleation in first order phase transitions toimagine a hadron as perturbative fields confined to avacuum bubble of size about 1 fm. The resulting model,developed with colleagues in 1974, became known asthe “MIT bag model”[738]. The starting point is a pos-tulated nontrivial QCD vacuum that exerts a pressure(described by the constant B) on a region of trivialspace-time (called the “bag”). The model HamiltonianisLbag = (LQCD −B) θ(bag) (5.1.1)where θ is zero outside the bag region. Because the ac-tion involves an integration over a finite region of space,the location of the bag surface is itself a dynamical field,related through the Euler-Lagrange equations to thequark and gluon fields by a complicated, nonlinear ex-pression. As a result quantization is very difficult andsemiclassical approximations are used to study the sys-tem. In particular, the “static bag approximation” ismade, wherein quarks and gluons are presumed to beconfined to a region of a given radius (it is possible tomake more complicated models where small oscillationsin the bag surface are permitted). The resulting equa-tions of motion describe free fields subject to cavityboundary conditions, which can be obtained by sum-ming cavity modes.
Almost simultaneously, similar ideas were being ex-ploredatStanford,givingrisetothe“SLACbagmodel”[739]. In this case a scalar field played a role simi-lar to the bag. Symmetry breaking in the scalar vac-uum served to confine quarks to a small region wherethe scalar field exhibits soliton-like behavior. However,this implies that quarks are confined to a sphericalshell, which contradicts experiment[740]. A subsequentmodel, called the “soliton bag model”, is able to avoidthis feature while interpolating the MIT and SLACbag models[741]. Many variant bag models have beendeveloped over the years that seek to address variousshortcomings. For example, the MIT, SLAC, and soli-ton models all violate chiral symmetry. This can beovercome by explicitly introducing pion fields[742, 743]or topological features[744]. Other models will be dis-cussed below.
A number of advantages of bag models are appar-ent: hadrons are bound systems of relativistic quarksand gluons, obey asymptotic freedom automatically,are confined to regions of order 1 fm in size, and re-spect color gauge invariance. These benefits spurred alargetheoreticaleffortinhadronicmodellingthatlastedthrough the 1980s, and continues at a reduced levelto the present. Unfortunately, the complexity of themodel introduces a number of conceptual and techni-cal difficulties. The cavity approximation, for example,is not translationally invariant and no projection ontomomentum eigenstates exits. This has the practical de-merit of introducing undesired center of mass degreesof freedom to the problem. Quark and gluon propaga-tors can be formed by summing over appropriate cavitymodes, but in practice this is difficult, and evaluatingFeynman diagrams is technically cumbersome[740]. Forexample, self-energy diagrams are difficult to evaluateand are often ignored. Similarly, the expectation valueof the bag Hamiltonian has a sum over zero point ener-gies that diverges. Renormalizing this quantity is sub-tle, and the zero point energy is often replaced with asimple model. Lastly, the rigid cavity gives rise to spu-rious states that must be identified.
Early MIT bag model computations contained threeparameters, the bag constant, the gauge coupling, anda zero-point energy parameter. Fits to theρ, N, and∆masses then fixed these constants. Unfortunately theresulting value for the strong coupling wasαS ≈2.2,which gives spin splittings that are too large in otherhadrons. The resulting phenomenology is often of poorquality; for example, an early calculation of P-wavemasses gives disappointing results[745]. Bag model phe-nomenologyisclearlygearedtowardlighthadrons.Heavy112 5 APPROXIMATE QCDJP color flavor0+ ¯3 ¯31+ ¯3 60− ¯3 61− ¯3 ¯3Table 5.1.1Diquark quantum numbersquark states, on the other hand, are surely describedby nonrelativistic kinematics, a string-like confinementmechanism, and a value of the strong coupling that isset byαS(mQ). These features can be incorporated byallowing the bag to distort into a tube shape (in prac-tice the distortion is small) and refitting the model pa-rameters[746]. The resulting model does a reasonablejob with the low lying charmonium and bottomoniumvectors, predicts aJ/ψ−ηc splitting of 180 MeV (themeasured value is 113 MeV), andJPC = 1 −± charmo-nium (bottomonium) hybrids at mass of approximately4.0 (10.49) GeV.
One of the great advantages of bag models is thatthey made it clear that states incorporating gluonicdegrees of freedom (glueballs and hybrids) should beconsidered seriously. Early contributions to the theoryof glueballs include Jaffe and Johnson[747], who exam-ined many novel states in the model, and Barnes, Close,and Monaghan, who computed spin-dependent massshifts in the glueball spectrum[748]. These shifts arevery large when common model parameters are used,givingglueballmassesof m(0++) = 100 MeV,m(0−+) =400 MeV, andm(2++) = 1300 MeV, all of which are instrong disagreement with modern lattice values[745].
Studies of hybrid (q¯qg) mesons originated in theMIT bag model[749] only a few years after the adventof both QCD and bag models, thereby raising interestin these novel states and highlighting the unusual (“ex-otic”) quantum numbers that are available to these sys-tems.EarlycomputationsintheMITbagmodelworkedto first order and focussed on light hybrid mesons[750,751], obtaining, for example, aJPC = 1−+ light hybridmass of 1300 MeV[752].
Problems with complexity and fidelity have causedbag models to largely fall out of favor as descriptionsof hadrons. They do, however, continue to find applica-tions in models of strongly interacting matter or othercomplex hadronic systems.
5.1.4 Diquark ModelsTwoquarksinabaryonexperiencea(perturbative)mu-tual attraction that is one half of the strength of thatbetween a quark and an antiquark in a meson. If thethird quark is isolated in some sense, it is fruitful toconsider this quark-quark state as a compact object,called adiquark. More generally, a diquark is any sys-tem of two quarks considered collectively. The idea isalready mentioned by Gell-Mann in 1964[716] and wasintroduced in Refs. [754] and [755] as a way to reducethree-body dynamics to the computationally simplertwo-body dynamics.
In general a pair of quarks, denoted[qq] in the fol-lowing, can form¯3 and 6 color states, with the formerbeingantisymmetricandthelatterbeingsymmetricun-der quark interchange. Because a pair of quarks in the6 representation has a (perturbative) repulsive interac-tion ( +αS/(6r)), diquarks are only considered in the¯3 representation. In this case, possible quantum num-bers for[qq′] are as listed in Table5.1.3. The first twoof these entries are often called “good” and “bad” di-quarks respectively[753].
An early application of diquarks was to the descrip-tion of light baryons[756]. The primary effect is a re-duction in the number of degrees of freedom comparedto a “symmetric” quark model, with commensurate de-crease in the complexity of the excitation spectrum.
For example, a symmetric quark model will feature or-bitalexcitationsintworelativecoordinates(oftentakento be the Jacobi coordinates⃗ ρand ⃗λ) while a quark-diquark bound state can only have orbital excitations ina single relative coordinate. It is telling that this simplediagnostic is difficult to apply since so little is knownof the excited baryon spectrum (but see Sec. Baryons).
Light baryons do experience flavor-dependent cor-relations, which might be attributed to diquarks. Forexample, a neutron will have a negative charge radiusbecause thedquarks are in a spin-one state and are re-pelled via the hyperfine interaction, leaving the positiveu quark in the center (on average). Similarly, diquarkoverlaps (denoted byI) affect static observables like theratio of magnetic moments and the ratio of axial andvector couplings:µpµn= −4 + 5 I2 + 4 I,⏐⏐⏐⏐GAGV⏐⏐⏐⏐= 2 + 3 I2 + I . (5.1.2)Unfortunately, the additional freedom (represented byI) does not permit a simultaneous fit to the experimen-tal values of -1.46 and 1.25, respectively[756].
At a more formal level, the similarity of light quarksmakes it difficult to separate one quark from the othertwo. In the extreme case of identical quarks, antisym-metrization of the state implies that such a separationis not feasible. This was noted long ago by Lichten-berg[757], who suggested including exchange forces toaccommodate transitions of the formq[qq] →[qq]q. Ofcourse this implies that the diquark can no longer be5.1 Quark models 113Fig. 5.1.1 (a) Quark content of a diquark-antidiquark nonet. (b) Mass levels of ideally mixedq¯q nonet and diquark-antidiquarknonet. (c) Light scalar mesons. The shaded region indicates large widths. Figure from Ref. [753].
thought of a simple quasiparticle, but is rather some-thing with internal structure that can be modified andexcited.
Perhaps the most famous application of light di-quarks is as a model of the scalar mesons. In the 1970’sJaffe noted that a good diquark and a good antidiquarknaturally make a scalar nonet of states, as shown inFig. 5.1.1(a). This nonet forms a spectrum as shownin panel (b) with counting that contrasts strongly withthe “normal”q¯q scheme, shown at the top of panel (b).
Remarkably this scheme agrees with the observed spec-trum, as shown in panel (c)[753]. This ostensibly simpleobservation has a long and somewhat controversial his-tory, as general acceptance of the existence of the lightscalar mesonsf0(600) and κhas waxed and waned overthe years.
More recently, the diquark simplification has beenappliedtoBethe-Salpeterapproachestothebaryonspec-trumwithsomesuccess[ 758].Theconcepthasalsofoundsupport in lattice computations that see evidence forthe good light diquark[759].
The discovery of the X(3872) prompted a surgein modelling of exotic hadronics, and led to renewedinterest in diquarks. A prominent model, due to Ma-ianiandcollaborators[ 760],advocatedthatthe X(3872)is a JP = 1 + double diquark state with composition[cq]1[¯c¯q]0 + [cq]0[¯c¯q]1. This assignment sets the mass ofthe open charm diquark,m[cq] = 1933 MeV, and im-plies a rich spectrum of exotic states. A novel predic-tion of the model is thattwo neutral vector exotic statesshould exist with a mass difference of approximately8 MeV. Focussing on flavor quantum numbers, theseare mixtures of [cu][¯c¯u] and [cd][¯c¯d]. Amongst others,scalar states are predicted at 3723 MeV and 3832 MeV.
In spite of the explanatory power of the model, andreasonable agreement with properties of theX(3872),none of these additional states have been observed. (Fora complete discussion of this issue, see Sec.8.5.2.)Notwithstanding the checkered history of the di-quark model, it must become relevant as quark massesbecome much greater than the QCD scale,Λ. In thiscase the quarks will sit deeply in a Coulombic well, arecompact, and are described well by perturbative gluonexchange. It is widely believed that bottom quarks aresufficiently heavy for these phenomena to occur. If apair of bottom quarks forms a hadron with light de-grees of freedom (such as light quarks or gluons), thenit is reasonable to model the bottom quarks as a[bb]diquark, and this expectation becomes rigorous as theheavy quark mass becomes very large.
A consequence of this concerns spin splittings inheavy-light mesons and baryons, as first observed bySavage and Wise[761]. In the followingQ represents aquark with mass larger than the QCD scale,Λ(thus b,c), whileqrepresents a quark with mass much less thanΛ. The latter then refers touand dquarks. The strangequark is ambiguous in this classification, and is some-times grouped with the light quarks, and sometimeswith heavy quarks. In practice heavy quark symmetriesonly become clear at the bottom mass and higher, whilelight quark (chiral) symmetry applies well tou and dquarks, and fairly well tos quarks.
Heavy quark spin degrees of freedom interact viatheir color dipole moments, which permits relating spinsplittings inQQq baryons and ¯Q′q states, with a rela-tionship given by114 5 APPROXIMATE QCDmΣ∗(Q) −mΣ(Q) = 32mQ′mQ(αS(mQ)αS(mQ′))9/33−2nf×(mV(Q′) −mP(Q′)). (5.1.3)Here V and P refer to vector and pseudoscalar mesons,while Σ∗ and Σ refer to ground state and spin-excitedQQq baryons.
A slightly more model-dependent application estab-lishes that the heavyJP = 1 + ud¯b¯b tetraquark statemust be strongly bound. The argument relies on thespin splittings, Σb −Λb and Ξ′b −Ξb, which indicatethat the(¯3F,0,¯3c) light diquark lies approximately 100MeV below the spin-averaged light diquark mass. Thisdiquark interacts with ab meson with quantum num-bers (1F,12 ,3c) to produce the relevant baryons. As ar-gued above, and verified by smallB∗ −B and Σ∗b −Σbmass splittings, the heavy (di)quark spin must decouplefrom the light degrees of freedom. Thus a light diquarkhas a similar mass when coupled to a heavy [¯b¯b] di-quark. Since the heavy diquark has quantum numbers(3F,0,3c), the [ud][¯b¯b] tetraquark has quantum num-bers I = 0 ,1/2 and JP = 1 +. Recent lattice field the-ory computations have proven these expectations cor-rect[762].
Diquarks continue to find application in a varietyof areas: reducing the daunting complexity that arisesin Bethe-Salpeter equations for many-quark systems,Sec. 5.3, the operator-product expansion, Sec.5.8, in-stanton vacuum modelling, Sec.5.11, heavy quark ef-fective field theory, Sec.6.1, models of quark matter,Sec. 7.2, tetraquark models, Sec.8.5, baryons, Secs.9.1,9.2, 9.4, and models of hadronization, Sec.11.4.
5.1.5 Current DevelopmentsThe advent of new theoretical tools and the discov-ery of many novel hadrons have fueled the continueddevelopment of the constituent quark model. Amongstthe latter are theX(3872) that strongly hints atqq¯q¯qstructure and the importance of coupling mesons tothe meson-meson continuum. Strong evidence for statesconsistingof qqqq¯q,called“pentaquarks”,alsoexists.Atthe same time, the maturation of lattice field theory haspermitted the theoretical exploration of many nonper-turbative hadronic properties and novel states involv-ing glue, such as glueballs and hybrids. Such studiesalso inform the development of refined quark modelsthat are capable of describing an ever greater range ofphenomena. The development of effective field theoryand its application to hadronic physics has also greatlyexpanded and strengthened the base upon which quarkπρA2KK\*K\*\*η, η′ ϕf′ ηCJ/ψχcηbΥχb13S111S013P2Fig. 5.1.2“A graphic illustration of the universality of mesondynamics”. Figure taken from the original[763].
models are developed. Finally, field-theoretic nonper-turbativemethods,suchasthosebasedontheSchwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter methods, have served to ex-pand the understanding and purview of quark models.
These new tools have helped to clarify several long-standing issues in the field. For example, it is well-known that the pion is anomalously light because itis the pseudo-Goldstone boson of QCD, reflecting the(broken) near chiral symmetry of the theory. Alterna-tively, the pion is light in quark models because thehyperfine interaction drives its mass well below that ofthe rho meson. The size of this mass splitting isinfiniteaccording to the one gluon exchange interaction (be-cause it is proportional toδ(r))! In practice the hyper-fine operator is smeared, which introduces a smearingparameter that can be fit to obtain the pion mass. Thisis hardly a satisfactory situation! In spite of this, Isgurhas argued that the smooth evolution of hyperfine split-ting from bottomonium to light quarks (Fig.5.1.2) is asign that the formalism is correct[763]. How these viewscan be made consistent is demonstrated in a specificmodel in Ref. [764], wherein it is shown how chiral sym-metry breaking induced by a nontrivial vacuum and aneffective hyperfine interaction mesh in a smooth fash-ion. Further insight is gained from the Schwinger-Dysonformalism, which convincingly demonstrates that chiralsymmetry breaking gives rise to both a light pion anda dynamical quark mass that can be interpreted as theconstituent quark[765].
Recent results from the lattice and other theoreti-cal analyses indicate that long-held notions are likelyincorrect. For example, scalar confinement cannot becorrect–it has been known since the 1980s that a con-finingscalar q¯qinteractionimplies ananti-confining qqqinteraction because of the lack of an antiquark line.5.1 Quark models 115(Thisdisasterwasavoidedin,forexample,theGodfrey-Isgur and Capstick-Isgur models by simply applying anextra sign.) The problem appears again in attempts atinducing chiral symmetry breaking in model field the-ories, where it is learned that scalar confinement inter-actions do not lead to a stable BCS-like vacuum[766].
In fact, it is not clear at all that the long range quarkinteraction need be described by a two-body interactionof the sort given above; QCD is much more complicatedthan this simple model[767].
Recent computations in lattice field theory have es-sentially settled the matter. This work relies on themodel-independent expansion of the quark interactionin terms of nonperturbative matrix elements of gluonicoperators[767, 768], which are evaluated numerically.
The results disagree strongly with an assumed scalarlong range interaction. They do agree in large part witha Dirac vector interaction, with the exceptions that thehyperfine interaction resembles a smeared delta func-tion and the spin orbit interactions have effective stringtensions that are reduced by a factor of approximately77%[769]. The picture emerging is that perturbativegluon exchange dominates the interaction at very shortdistances (less than 0.1 fm) and an effective vector-like interaction dominates at intermediate ranges. Atlong range (greater than 1 fm), one must saturate gluonexchange with a sum over hybrid intermediate states.
This brings in the nonperturbative matrix elements ofchromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields (mentionedabove) that give rise to the nontrivial structure seen inlattice field theory. It is somewhat ironic that early en-thusiasm for perturbative gluon exchange has evolvedin this fashion!Other quark model lore from the 1980s has beensweptawayinasimilarfashion.Forexample,theGodfrey-Isgur computation of meson decay toγγ employed aperturbative amplitude with a “mock meson” correc-tion factor involving the meson mass. More sophisti-cated computations where the amplitude is computedwith relativistic quark currents and a sum over interme-diate states is made reveal good agreement with dataand no need for artificial factors[770].
5.1.6 Open ProblemsOne of the major goals in modern quark modelling isincorporating the effects of nonperturbative gluonic de-grees of freedom, which, of course, permits modellingglueballs and hybrid hadrons. Outright guesses fromthe past have been superseded by a body of lattice ex-plorations of gluonic properties. Among these are thespectrum of adiabatic gluonic excitations[771, 772], thegluelump (bound states of gluons and a static adjointV(X) V(X)X X(a) (b)113124 113124114123114123813824814823¯312334Fig. 5.1.3“The adiabatic potentials of the flux tube model (a)and of the⃗Fi· ⃗Fj potential model (b) for twoqq¯q¯qgeometries.”Figure taken from the original[763].
color source) spectrum[486, 773–775], and propertiesof charmonium hybrids[776–778]. Of particular inter-est is the confirmation that the heavy quark multipletstructure anticipated in Ref. [772] is reflected in thecharmonium spectrum[776]. It is interesting, and verysuggestive, that this multiplet structure can be repro-duced by degrees of freedom consisting of a quark, anantiquark, and an effective axial gluon with quantumnumbers JPC = 1+−[493], pointing the way to possiblefuture models.
The advent of compelling experimental evidence fortetra- and pentaquark states has heightened interestin modelling multiquark hadrons. This is an old field,which in the past suffered from sufficiently poor compu-tationsthatIsgurdubbeditthe“multiquarkfiasco”[ 763].
Many technical problems were present in these calcula-tions, but the chief physics problem is the nature ofthe quark interaction when more than three quarksare present. The issue, for example, is that aqq¯q¯q canseparate into two meson-meson channels and that thegluonic degrees of freedom should experience adiabaticsurface crossing when transitioning between these con-figurations (see Fig.5.1.3). Thus new gluonic interac-tionsarenecessarilyintroducedinmultiquarkstates.Ofcourse, one could always model these as a sum of two-body interactions with a perturbative color structure,but this seems unlikely to be viable. A widely acceptedmodel of multiquark gluodynamics does not exist yet,and is urgently needed.
Multiquark states necessarily couple to systems ofmesonsandbaryons,whichmakesitincumbentonmod-ellers to understand the effects of coupled channels onhadronic properties. This requires knowing the effec-tive quark pair operator. A common model, dating to1969, has already been mentioned[732], but this cansurely be improved. As a result, existing models of Focksector mixing remain speculative. The problem is notamenable to effective field theory, so progress will likelyrely on input from lattice field theory. Progress is ur-116 5 APPROXIMATE QCDgent since channel coupling effects are expected to beimportant in many sectors of the spectrum, includingthe perpetually enigmatic light scalars mesons, and allstates near thresholds, such as theX(3872), thePc pen-taquarks, and theZc and Zb states.
It is perhaps a surprise that a model dating backnearly 60 years remains an active field of research. SucharethemysteriesofQCD.Onthingiscertain:thequarkmodel remains the de facto standard by which hadronsare interpreted.
5.2 Hidden ColorAlexandre DeurNuclear physics is one of the first rungs of the com-plexity ladder rising from our current fundamental un-derstanding of Nature in terms of the Standard Model.
The effective degrees of freedom (d.o.f) that emergein nuclear physics are the hadrons, namely nucleons,mesons and their excited states. Yet, effective theoriesare intrinsically limited, their effective d.o.f being insuf-ficient to account for peculiar phenomena, e.g., diffrac-tion for geometrical optics. Then, more fundamentald.o.f are necessary. Likewise, certain nuclear phenom-ena are not reducible to hadronic d.o.f and either par-tonic d.o.f or new effective d.o.f are necessary. Hiddencolor (HC) is such a phenomenon. In conventional nu-clear physics, a nucleus – such as the deuteron14 – iseffectively a bound state of individual nucleons. How-ever, at the more fundamental level of QCD, the nu-clear eigenstate can also have additional multi-quarkFock states which have zero color overall, but do notcluster as a collection of nucleons. These Fock statesrepresent the HC d.o.f of nuclei.
The possibility of HC d.o.f [779–784] arises fromobserving that the representation of color singlet mul-tihadron systems allows for colored cluster (Cc, col-ored “hadrons”) components, e.g., a red-red-blue clus-ter bound to a green-green-blue cluster contributing tothe deuteron wavefunction. Such a configuration canequivalently be reexpressed as a sum of singlet com-ponents, but without well-defined clustering propertiessinceagivenvalencequarkhasasubstantialprobabilityto belong to any of the singlet states. Therefore, regard-less of what (equivalent) representation is preferred, itcannot be expressed with singlet hadronic clusters, i.e.,colorless hadronic d.o.f. This is HC. Clearly, HC goesbeyond traditional nuclear physics but is a natural ex-pectation of the underlying theory, QCD. HC predicts14 Throughout this section, deuteron is used as example ofnuclear system, but the discussion is generic to multi-nucleonsystems.
nuclear states not describable with usual hadronic d.o.fbut with multiquark wavefunctions, e.g., 6-quark sin-glet states, or singlet systems made ofCc. The latterperspective renders intuitive that HC states are short-distance binding configurations.
For example, in a hadronic basis of nucleonN, ∆and Cc d.o.f (for simplicity we ignore otherN∗ isobarscontributions), the deuteron is a sum ofNN, ∆∆ andCcCc components, the latter dominating at short dis-tance, viz, largeQ2 [785]:|D⟩= |NN⟩+ |∆∆⟩+ |CcCc⟩with|NN⟩=13 |[6]{33}⟩+23 |[42]{33}⟩−23 |[42]{51}⟩,(5.2.1)|∆∆⟩=√445 |[6]{33}⟩+√1645 |[42]{33}⟩+√2545 |[42]{51}⟩,(5.2.2)|CcCc⟩=√45 |[6]{33}⟩−√15 |[42]{33}⟩, (5.2.3)where [ ] and { }label respectively the orbital andspin-isospin symmetries which are characterized by thebracketed number in the usual Young tableau way, e.g.,[6] ≡signifies 6 quarks ins-shell, or[42] ≡is for 4 quarks in s-shell and 2 in p-shell [786]. ForQ2 →∞, [6] dominates over[42]. Thus, the deuteronstate is [6]{33}symmetric (and totally antisymmetricoverall), from which4/5 comes from the HC component,Eq. (5.2.3). The 80% dominance of HC at largeQ2 istherefore expected to control elastic scattering off thedeuteron in this limit. In fact, the ratio of the reduceddeuteron form factor (i.e., normalized to the nucleonform factor squared) to that of the pion is about 15%for Q2 of a few GeV2, indicating 15% of HC in|D⟩atthis scale [785]. That|NN⟩and |∆∆⟩nearly vanish atlarge Q2 means that two singlet hadrons tend to notbe found close to each others, i.e., the traditional (viz,between singlet hadrons) nuclear force is repulsive atshort distance. The rise withQ2 of [6] over [42] tellsus that the components of|D⟩behave differently withQ2. Their evolutions come from gluon exchange andwere calculated in Refs. [787–789]. It was shown thatthe singletpn state of the deuteron prevalent at smallQ2 evolves into 5 states: itself and 4 HC states.
The number of HC states quickly increases with themass number A of the system. ForA = 1 there is 1singlet state and no HC state:3 ⊗3 ⊗3 = 10 ⊕8 ⊕8 ⊕1,5.2 Hidden Color 117the last being the color singlet, the nucleon. For thedeuteron, A= 2 and3 ⊗3 ⊗3 ⊗3 ⊗3 ⊗3= 28 ⊕5(35) ⊕9(27) ⊕15(10)⊕16(8) ⊕5(10∗) ⊕5(1),with the 5 last states 5(1) being the singlet states.
Since there can be only one singlet state made of col-orless 3-quark clusters –the traditionalpn (or isobars)state– the four remaining singlet states are HC states.
For A = 3 , there are 41 HC states [790]. Calculatingstrictly within QCD the Q2-evolution of nuclear am-plitudes is presently not possible: Just |D⟩ at lead-ing order involves millions of Feynman graphs. Usinga hadronic effective QFT is not helpful because addingthe HC d.o.f negates the theory predicability [790]. Asolution is to use thereduced nuclear amplitude tech-nique [779,791]. Based on LF QCD [792,793], it modelsnuclear scattering amplitudes that obey QCD countingrules [134] (Section 5.10) and gauge invariance. Themethod neglects nuclear binding so that a nucleus ismodeled as a cluster of collinear hadrons. Thus, thenuclear LFWF factorizes as a product of LFWF of nu-cleons in the nucleus times those of quarks in a nucleon:ψA = ψN/A∏N ψq/N, with the convenient LFWF prob-abilistic interpretation of the Fock states retained.
What are the possible signals for HC? An intuitiveone is the yield ratio(γd → ∆++∆−)/(γd → pn); if|D⟩con-tainedonlyastateoftwoweaklyboundsinglethadrons,duu⃝ dud⃝,it would not break into auuu⃝ddd⃝= ∆++∆−.
However, a 6-quark|uuuddd⟩state can well split into∆++ and ∆−.
There are other possible HC signatures [785]: thedominance of HC at short distances makes large an-gle Compton scattering and pion photoproduction offthe deuteron prime channels to search for HC. In elec-tron scattering, the deuteron form factor at largeQ2should not be explainable with hadronic d.o.f. Likewise,the deuteron inclusive tensor spin structure functionb1,a leading-twist quantity, is expected to be especiallysensitive to HC [794]. Short range correlation (SRC)measurements can also provide a signal for HC as theyprobe the 2-nucleon potential at short distance. Thus,SRC data should be sensitive to the repulsion expectedby HC and signaled by the vanishing of the|NN⟩and|∆∆⟩components. The quasi-elastic reaction (to accesslarge x) at highQ2 resolves the nucleons of a nucleusand provides the SRC of nucleon pairs. The ratio ofpn over pp pairs was found to be 5 times larger thanthe standard hadronic expectation [795, 796]. This maystem from the repulsive core of the 2-nucleon poten-tial. Furthermore, the measurement of the strength of3-nucleon correlations in A >2 nuclei indicates thattheir contribution is larger in heavy nuclei than initiallyexpected, suggestive of the rapid increase of number ofHC states withA. A challenge with SRC measurementsisthefast Q2 fall-offofformfactors,soonemayalterna-tively study, also at largeQ2 and highx, the behaviorof inclusive structure functions which should obey inthat regime the QCD dimensional counting rules basedon the numberns of spectator partons [134] (see Sec-tion 5.10),xF(x) ∼(1 −x/2)2ns−1.
In the maximumx→2 limit for the deuteron,ns = 5for HC (6-quark system) butns = 2 without a domi-nantHCstate.HCevidencemaycomefromindirectob-servations:withoutHC,theonlyprocessbindinghadronsnot sharing covalent quarks is glueball exchange. HCprovides additional processes [787] which may be nec-essary to explain the structure of neutron stars [797,798].
HC may have already been observed. We mentionedthe SRC observations and that the deuteron form fac-tor normalized to the nucleon form factor squared is15% that of the pion. TheI(JP) = 0(3 +) of the well-established d∗(2380) (or D03) p-n resonance [799–807]compellingly suggests that it is a 6-quark system withdominant HC [808–813]. Furthermore, while its dynam-ical decay properties can also be explained by a∆∆state, the narrow 70 MeV width of thed∗ is 3 timessmaller than expected for the∆∆but agrees with a HCstate. Refs. [814, 815] reviewed recently thed∗(2380)properties. Similarly, the narrow de-excitation of4He∗through e+e− emission seen at ATOMKI [816] can beunderstood as the4He nucleus being excited into a 12-quark HC state made of 5 colored ud pairs (hexadi-quark) [817]: it was shown that the ATMOKI anomalycannot be accounted for by standard electromagneticdecay without producing first a HC state [818]. Thelatter also explains the unusually strong binding of the4He nucleus. Another possible observation of HC comesthe b1 data from HERMES [819]. They are positive forx< 0.1 but appear to become negative aroundx≃0.3,which is expected of a 6-quark HC state [794].
These signals each hint at the existence of hidden-color degrees of freedom. By reaching higherxand Q2,the 12 GeV upgrade of JLab and the future EIC [820]will provide the opportunity to confirm this fundamen-tal feature of QCD.118 5 APPROXIMATE QCD-1 -1= + + +~~~~ g2, g4-1 g4A= K+g g+ G4=BFig. 5.3.1 Top row: The exact DSE for the inverse dressedfermion propagator (in the dotted box), and its approximationto 4th order in QED.

5.3 DS/BS equationsF ranz Gross and Pieter Maris5.3.1 IntroductionIn this section we look at two closely related approachesto treating the strong interactions that existed before1972, and remained very useful, even after the onsetof QCD. One of these originated with papers by Dyson(1949) [821] and Schwinger(1951) [822,823], referred toas the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs), and the sec-ond is the well known Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)[824], introduced in 195115.
In general, the DSEs form an infinite set of coupledintegral equations for the Green’s functions Gn of aquantum field theory.16 These equations are exact, butin practical calculations this set has to be truncated.
The equations can be derived formally from the matrixelements of the Lagrangian density (as was done in theoriginal papers), or in the path-integral formalism usingfunctional derivatives [831], but Feynman diagrams canbe used to providea simple, pictorial way to understandthem. Using QED as an example17, Fig. 5.3.1 showsthe exact DSEs needed to describe the self-energy ofeach fermion, and the dressedψiγµψiAµ vertex Γµi .
15 Although the BSE can be used to describe scattering, thisseminal paper was entitled A relativistic equation for boundstate problems , particularly serendipitous for applications toQCD, where all physical states are bound states of quarks, an-tiquarks and gluons.
16 For recent reviews of the DSEs in the context of QCD andhadron physics, see Refs. [765, 825–830]17 WhenappliedtoQCD,withthephotonreplacedbyagluon,additional terms, such as the 3-gluon vertex, must be added.

The fermion-antifermion scattering amplitudeG4 ofthe two different fermions can be written as a series ofinteractions shown in the upper line of Fig.5.3.2. Herethe kernelK is the sum ofirreducible contributions tothe off-shell scattering (i.e. diagrams that cannot be re-duced by drawing an internal line through the diagramthat intersects only the two fermions). The infinite se-ries of iterations of the irreducible diagrams (each re-ferred to as reducible because it can be cut into twopieces by an internal line which intersects only the twoparticles), connected by dressed propagators, is thensummed by the equation shown in the LHS of the mid-dle line. This is the DSE18. for the scattering amplitudeG4. If a bound state exists, it shows up as pole in thisscattering amplitude, as illustrated in the RHS of thesecond line of Fig.5.3.2. The BSE for the Bound StateAmplitude (BSA) or vertex function,Γ (shown in thebottom line), has the same kernel asG4. Figure 5.3.3shows contributions to the QED kernel up to orderg6.
There is no known way to sum these contributions inclosed form.
18 For two particle scattering, DSE and BSE are used inter-changeably.5.3 DS/BS equations 119The bound state BSEAs an example, the BSE for aq¯Q bound state in QEDisΓMB(p; ˆP) =∫ d4k(2π)4 Kij(p,k; ˆP)OiχMB(k; ˆP)Oj→4πα∫ d4k(2π)4 Dνµ(p,k; ˆP)γνχMB(k; ˆP)γµ, (5.3.1)where χMB(k; ˆP) is the BS wave functionχMB(k; ˆP) = S2(k2)ΓMB(k; ˆP)S1(k1) , (5.3.2)with Si(ki) the dressed propagator for particlei andˆP2 = M2B.Thefirstlineisexact,withthekernelwrittenin the general formK = KijOi⊗Oj19; the second lineis theladder truncation with the kernel describing onephoton exchange only, soK →4παDνµγν ⊗γν. Diracindices have been suppressed, and the four-momentumof the incomingQ is p1 = p−(1 −η) ˆP and of the out-going q is p2 = p+ ηˆP, reflecting the fact that the to-tal momentum ˆP is conserved in relativistic equations.
The physical observables do not depend on the choiceof η, and the natural choice for mesons with equal-massconstituents (like a pion) isη = 12 . The canonical nor-malization condition for the BSE bound state vertexfunction can be derived directly from the inhomoge-neous BSE (see e.g. Refs. [831, 832]).
Very soon after the BSE was introduced, Wick [833]showed that the equation could be transformed fromMinkowski space to Euclidean space by rotating thetime component to the imaginary axis{t,r}→{ iτ,r}(nowreferredtoasaWickrotation).BuildingonWick’sresults, Cutkosky [834] found all the exact solutions tothe bound state BSE inladder truncation for a scalartheory of the χ2φ type where the exchange particleφ is massless. The solutions are symmetric under theO(4) symmetry group, and hence have the same de-generacy as the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom. Some ofthe solutions correspond to excitations in the time di-rection that have no nonrelativistic analogues. Further-more, these solutions have a negative norm (at least inQED and QCD), and are therefore unphysical. As far aswe know, no other analytic solutions have been found,but in the last 25 years accurate solutions of the BSE inladder truncation have been obtained numerically forboth scalar and fermionic systems, discussed below.
Several facts about the BSE are sometimes over-looked:• The equation shown in Fig.5.3.2 is exact, but onlyif theexact kernel and self energies are known.
19 Each of the operators Oi describes the structure of thedressed vertices, including possibilities like those illustrated indiagrams (2) and (3) of Fig.5.3.3•AllapplicationsoftheBSEarethereforeapproxima-tions using an approximate kernel and self-energies.
•In addition to Eq. 5.3.1, which is a homogeneousequation, there is also a canonical normalizationcondition for the BSA; one should not normalizethe BSA to a convenient observable.
Methods to solve the BSE in Minkowski metricDue to the presence of poles in both the constituentpropagators and in the kernel (coming from the ex-changed bosons), it is highly nontrivial to solve the BSEnumerically in Minkowski metric, even in ladder trun-cation. There are two methods to investigate the BSEdirectly in Minkowski metric, both dating back to thelate 60s: the Covariant Spectator Theory (CST) whichwe discuss in Sec.5.3.2, and use of the Nakanishi repre-sentation (also known as Perturbation Theory IntegralRepresentation) [835].
The Nakanishi representation for the BSA is a spec-tral representation in which the singularities that arisefrom the poles in the propagators are isolated, allowingthe BSE to be reduced to an integral equation for the(non singular) spectral function. This has been doneinitially for scalar field theory [836], and subsequentlyforfermion-antifermionboundstates[ 837–839].Theob-tained BSAs have been benchmarked against direct nu-mericalsolutionsoftheladderBSEforEuclidean(space-like) relative momenta.
Recently, the scalar BSE in ladder truncation hasalso been investigated in Minkowski metric by startingin the Euclidean formulation and rotating thep4 axis toip0 (i.e. undoing the Wick rotation numerically) [840],andbyusingcontourdeformationsinordertoavoidsin-gularities [841]. These methods give, within numericalprecision, the same results for the BSA in the timelikeregion as the Nakanishi representation.
Connection to the Light-Front wavefunctionThe use of the light-front (LF, first referred to as theinfinite momentum frame) was introduced by Weinbergin 1966 [842], and the technique was developed very ex-tensively in the 1980’s by Lepage and Brodsky [207] andmany others. It is now a standard method for describ-ing the structure of hadrons and calculating a range ofobservables. Application of this technique will be ex-tensively discussed in Sec. 5.4. Use of the LF is notmanifestly rotationally invariant, but this can be han-dled by imposing the so-called angular conditions; see,for example, Ref. [843].
The LF wave function can be obtained fromχ(p; P)by integrating overp− = p0−p3, leavingp0+p3 ≡xP+and p⊥ = {px,py}as independent variables. It turnsoutthattheLFwavefunction, ψ(x,p⊥),isonlynonzero120 5 APPROXIMATE QCDfor 0 < x <1, and vanishes outside this range, eventhoughp+ runsfromminusinfinitytoplusinfinity.Thishas been confirmed numerically for scalar theories inladder truncation.
InsteadofsolvingtheBSEinMinkowskimetric,andthen projecting onto the light-front, one can also recon-struct the LF wave function (or e.g. parton distribu-tions) from their moments, which can be evaluated di-rectly from the BS wave function [844–846]. One caveatto keep in mind is that the BSE is typically solved in co-variant gauges; the most commonly used gauge in theliterature is the Landau gauge, though other gaugessuch as Feynman gauge are also used. On the otherhand, the LF wave function is usually investigated inLF gauge. This makes it nontrivial to compare LF wavefunctions obtained from the explicitly covariant BSE toLF wavefuctions obtained within a LF approach.
5.3.2 The Covariant Spectator Theory (CST)The CST, which is related, but not identical, to theBSE, can be obtained from the BSE if the internal loopenergy is evaluated keeping only the pole contributionfrom the heaviest particle [847].20 If m+ = m1 >m2 =m−,η= 12 , treatingparticle1asoutgoing,andworkingin the rest frame whereP = {W,0}, then p1 = 12 P −p, and the one-channel CST equation can be obtainedfrom (5.3.1) using the prescription21Γ(p; P) = −i∫ d4k(2π)4F(p,k; P)d+(k)d−(k)→∫ d3k(2π)32E+k[F(p,ˆk; P)δ2m + W(2E+k −W)],(5.3.3)where d±(k) = m2± −(k∓12 P)2 −iϵ, F is any covariantfunction, ˆk1 = 12 W −ˆk = {E+k ,k}, (E+k )2 = m2+ + k2,so that (ˆk+)2 = m2+, and δ2m = m2− −m2+. The CSTequation is covariant in three dimensional space, and,unlike the LF, is rotationally invariant. The major mo-tivation for the use of CST equations is that they havea smooth nonrelativistic limit, and in a few cases theirladder approximation is more accurate than the ladderapproximation to the BSE. Their major disadvantage isthat their kernels can be singular, and the treatment ofthese introduces an additional level of phenomenology(see below).
In scalar field theories whenm1 →∞, it has beenshown that the sum of all ladders and crossed ladders20 This is sometimes referred to as “restricting the particle toits mass shell.”21 With our choice of momenta, this is obtained by closingthe k0 contour in the upper half plane and keeping only thepositive energy pole of particle 1, atk0 = 12 W − E+k.
(the generalized ladder sum) is given by the solutionof the CST equation withonly the one-boson-exchange(OBE) kernel (see Refs. [832] and [847]) 22. This is re-ferred to as thecancellation theorem.
While the complete cancellation holds only in anexceptional case, partial cancellations occur for othercases.UsingtheFeynman-Schwingerrepresentation[ 848],it is possible to calculate the exact result for the gen-eralized ladder sum without vertex or self-energy cor-rections. For scalar theories wherem1 = m2 ̸= ∞andthe exchanged massµ= 0 .15 m [849], the BSE in lad-der approximation gives only about one-quarter of thecorrect binding energy (at large coupling), while theone-channel CST equation, also in ladder approxima-tion, gives a little more that half the correct result. TheOBE approximation in the light-front approach givesthe same result as the BSE in ladder approximation[850]23. Another approach, the equal-time (ET) favoredby Tjon[852] is slightly better than the CST, but onlythe CST (to our knowledge) uses the same two-bodyscattering amplitude in both the two-body and three-body systems. In a later paper [853], it was shown thatthe contributions of all self-energies and vertex correc-tions for scalar QED are very small, so that in this casethe generalized ladders dominate (and are well approx-imated by the CST and ET). These remarkable resultsapply only to scalar theories, so the main justificationfor the use of the CST must rest on its simple nonrela-tivistic limit.
It turns out that the one-body CST prescription(5.3.3)mustbegeneralizedifitistobeusedforallcasesincluding m− = m+ and W →0. To treat these lim-its successfully, all fourk0 poles from the two fermionpropagators must be included. There are two poles inthe upper halfk0 plane (r = −) and two in the lowerhalf (r = + ), and if s = ±denotes the poles fromparticles m±, then they can all be denoted byks0r =rEsk + 12 sW −irϵ. Since the contour can be closed ineither half plane (but not both), we average over thetwo choices.

ThesumontheRHSofthisequationhasfourterms,and substituting the four valuesp →ˆpsr into the LHS22 In other words, whenm1 → ∞, the CST in OBE approxi-mation gives the same result as the BSE for a kernel containingall irreducible crossed ladders.
23 This is not true for three-body systems, due to contribu-tions with two (or more) exchange bosons in flight, which areincluded in the ladder BSE, but not in the OBE approximationon the light-front [851].5.3 DS/BS equations 121givesfourcoupledequations. 24 Asdiscussedabove,onlyone channel is needed whenm+ →∞. When the parti-cles are identical, symmetry under interchange requiresthat the equation transform into itself whenp1 ↔p2,or k1 ↔ k2, and looking at ks0r shows that this re-quires (if P is not small) at least the channels where{r,s}= {+,+}and {−.−}, so that rs = + in bothcases. Looking at (5.3.4, it is clear that it is symmetricunder this transformation, remembering that for iden-tical particles,δ2m = 0 and E+k −E−k . Finally, whenWis small, there will be a singularity atW = 0 unless allfour channels are kept.
Unfortunately,whenaOBEkernelconnectsthechan-nel with particle 1 on-shell to the channel with particle2 is on-shell, the kernel will develop singularities. Theseare discussed in detail in Ref. [854], but the preferredway to remove them was only developed recently25.
Nuclear physics applications of the CSTThe two-channel CST has been used to give a highprecision fit to thenp scattering data below 350 MeV(χ2 = 1 .12 using only 15 parameters [854]), to explainthe deuteron form factors (giving a quadrupole momentwithin 1% of its experimental value [856]), and to studythe three nucleon system. All of these studies were donewith two models. The simplest and most successful oneuses a covariant OBE kernel consisting of the exchangeof 6 mesons:π, η, σ0 and σ1 (scalar mesons with isospin0 and 1), andρ and ω. An interesting feature of theseOBE models is that they include an off-shell couplingfor theσ mesons of the formΛσ(p,k) = gσ −νσ[1 −/p+ /k2m], (5.3.5)where the term proportional toνσ will give zero whenthe nucleons are on shell (with/p→m←/k). As it turnsout (see below), this off-shell coupling is very importantto the success of the model.
In the early days before the advent of QCD andpowerful computers, the study of three nucleon systemsposed special problems. The Alt-Grassberger-Sandhasequations [857], developed in 1967, introduced a sys-tematic procedure for finding the solutions ofn-bodyproblems from the solution of the n−1 body prob-lem. Examples of early papers working directly withthe the three nucleon equation are found in Ref. [858],which presents solutions with realistic potentials, andRef. [859], which solves the 3-body BSE with separablekernels.
24 This should be considered the correct form for the CST inall cases, but often some of the channels can be ignored.
25 FG: These singularities troubled me for years. They areintegrable, giving finite results, but only with the method de-scribed in Ref. [855] do I feel the problem is fully under theo-retical control.
Fig. 5.3.4 The red line (left-hand scale) shows howχ2 varieswith νσ, with the best fit atνσ ≃ −2.6. The blue line (right-hand scale) shows the (linear) variation of the triton bindingenergy with νσ, with the best fit also atνσ ≃ − 2.6. (FromRef. [860].)The three-body CST equation given in Ref. [861]was used to compute the triton binding energy [862],and the three-nucleon form factor [863, 864]. Duringthesestudiesaremarkablediscoverywasmade:thebestfits to the np data require νσ ̸= 0 26, and the samevalue of νσ also gives the best fit to the triton bind-ing energy! This shows that three body-forces are notneeded to explain this observable. This discovery, firstfound in 1996 [862], is shown with the latest (and best)fits in Fig.5.3.4. It is a robust result that has contin-ued to hold as the fits were improved, and is still notunderstood.
Meson spectrum in the CSTIn the CST treatment, mesons areqqbound states withone quark confined to its mass-shell. States like theρ, where mρ > 2mq, could have both the quark andanti-quark on-shell at the same time unless the inter-action forbids it. Fortunately, the structure of the CSTequations permits an attractive relativistic generaliza-tion of linear confinement. This definition of confine-ment was first introduced in 1991 [865], and in 1999it was shown explicitly that the confining interactiondoes indeed guarantee that meson vertex functions arezero when both quark and antiquark are on shell [866].
Subsequently, an improved definition [867] was found.

Onlyafter a frantic attempt to do better did we discover the impor-tance ofνσ. Later, we were surprised to realize that the samemechanism also gave the correct triton binding energy.122 5 APPROXIMATE QCD^kqp-p+P-P+X ^kqp-p+P-P+XXX++ ^kqp-p+P-P+XX^kqp-p+P-P+XX+/u1D6AA qkp-p+P-P+/u1D6AA X(1) (3)(2a) (2b)Fig. 5.3.5 The form factor of a bound state (meson ordeuteron).

it was suggested that I look at the deuteron electro-magnetic form factor. The upshot of my study lead to27 Since both the light front and CST are relativistic wavefunctions depending on only three variables, it has long beenthought that, perhaps, they can be transformed into one other.
The basis for such a comparison might be based on a connectionbetween one of the components of the CST internal momentum(take pz for example) and the LF momentum fractionx, and agood candidate isEp+ pz = yD0, where D0 is the energy ofthe bound state, andy = x. This transformation suggests anequivalence in some cases [871], but since0 ≤ y≤ ∞, it is clearthat y̸= x. Our conclusion is that CST and LF wave functionsseem to describe the physics differently.
the realization that the form factor was dominated bya large number of meson-exchange processes, the firstfour of which are shown in the left panel of Fig.5.3.528,and that these were best calculated by introducing anew equation that would sum these contributions – theone-channel CST equation.
If the internal propagators in the triangle diagram(right panel of Fig.5.3.5) are dressed by form factors,then the off-shell nucleon current must also be dressedin order to ensure gauge invariance29.
5.3.3 DSE for the quark propagatorWe now turn to a discussion of the DSE for the quarkpropagator. The exact equation for the quark propaga-tor is shown in the upper left-hand box in Fig.5.3.1.
In Euclidean metric ({γµ,γν} = 2 δµν, γ†µ = γµ anda·b= ∑4i=1 aibi.) it is given byS(p)−1 = i̸pZ2 + mq(µ) Z4+ Z1 g2∫ d4k(2π)4 Dµν(q) γµλi2 S(k) λi2 Γν(k,p) ,(5.3.7)where Dµν(q= k−p) is the renormalized dressed gluonpropagator, and Γν(k,p) is the renormalized dressedquark-gluon vertex. The solution of Eq. (5.3.7) can bewritten asS(p) = 1i/pA(p2) + B(p2) = Z(p2)i/p+ M(p2) , (5.3.8)renormalized according to S(p)−1 = i/ p+ mq(µ) ata sufficiently large spacelike µ2, with mq(µ) the cur-rent quark mass at the scaleµ. For divergent integralsa translationally-invariant regularization is necessary.
Note that in the chiral limit, the current quark massmq(µ) is absent from Eq. (5.3.7) and there is no massrenormalization.
The most commonly used truncation is the rainbowtruncation (analogous to the ladder truncation to the28 A novel feature of the dispersion integrals describing theseprocesses is the presence of anomalous thresholds starting atsi < 4m2. The imaginary part of the dispersion integral inthe anomalous region (fromsi to 4m2) is given entirely by thecontributions from these diagrams when the four-momentum ofall the spectators are on shell. For diagram (1) this thresholdis ats0 = M2Bm2(4m2 − M2B)≊ 16mϵwhere ϵ= 2 m− MB is the binding energy[872]. For diagrams(2a) and (2b), one additional spectator is on shell, and for dia-gram (3), two additional spectators are on shell. The thresholdsfor these diagrams are larger thans0 but still much less thanthe normal threshold of4m2.
29 D. O. Riska and I constructed such a current [873], which isused in all CST calculations. This current plays a role analogousto the BC or CP currents discussed below.5.3 DS/BS equations 12310-210-1100101102103104p2[GeV2]10-410-310-210-1100M(p2) [GeV]c-quarks-quarku/d-quarkchiral limit10-210-1100101102103p2 [GeV2]10-510-410-310-210-1100M(p2) [GeV] AsqtadoverlapDSE, N f =0DSE, N f =3DSE, N f =0, bare vertexmR ≈4.5 MeVmR ≈95 MeVFig.5.3.6 Dynamicalquarkmassfunction M(p2) forspacelikemomenta: using the rainbow truncation with the Maris–Tandymodel [876] (top, adapted from [ 877]), and from quenched(Nf = 0) and unquenched (Nf = 3 chiral quarks) DSEs us-ing the CP vertex [878], as well as results obtained with a barequark-gluon vertex, compared to quenched lattice data in theoverlap [879] and Asqtad [880] formulations (bottom, adaptedfrom [881])BSE discussed above), in which the dressed gluon prop-agator and the quark-gluon vertex are replaced by theirbare counter-parts, with a model effective running cou-plingZ1g2Dµν(q)γµ ⊗Γν(k,p) →4πα(q2) Dfreeµν (q)γµ ⊗γν.
(5.3.9)This truncation is the first term in a systematic expan-sion [874, 875]; furthermore, the preferred gauge for thefermion DSE is Landau gauge, which has the advantagethat asymptotically,Z(p2) →1.
By choosing a suitable model for the effective run-ning couplingαthat reduces asymptotically to leading-order perturbation theory, realistic quark mass func-tions, as shown in Fig.5.3.6, are obtained. In particu-lar, with a nonzero current quark mass, the dynamicalmass function behaves at largep2 likeM(p2) ≃ ˆm(ln [p/ΛQCD])γm , γm = 1211Nc −2Nf,(5.3.10)with the anomalous mass dimension,γm, in agreementwith perturbation theory. In the chiral limit this modelgives a nontrivial solution for the mass function thatfalls off like a power-law, modified by logarithmic cor-rections [882]Mchiral(p2) ≃2π2γm3−⟨¯qq⟩0p2 (ln [p/ΛQCD])1−γm, (5.3.11)with ⟨¯qq⟩0 the quark condensate, in agreement with theOperator Product Expansion [883].
Of course, quantitative details of the quark propa-gator functions in the infrared region do depend on thetruncation. The bottom panel of Fig.5.3.6 shows thequark mass function M(p2) of the quark propagatorin the chiral limit, obtained from the coupled quark,ghost, and gluon DSEs using the Curtis-Pennington(CP) vertex30 suitably generalized for use in a non-Abelian QFT [878]. Qualitatively, these results agreewith the quark mass functions shown in the top panel(both in the chiral limit, and with a nonzero currentquark mass), though quantitatively they clearly do de-pend on both the details of the effective interaction andthe vertex Ansatz.
Do real quark mass poles exist?Knowledge of the behavior of the quark propagator inthe complex momentum plane is necessary not only tosolvetheBSEattheboundstatemasspole,butalsobe-cause of possible connections to confinement, the CST,and the LF wave function. In QED, we know that realmass-poles must exist on the time-like axis, but earlyDSE studies of the fermion propagator in ladder trun-cation suggested the existence of complex “mass-like”singularities instead of real mass-poles at timelike mo-menta [885–887]. The absence of a mass-pole in thefermion propagator on the timelike axis would preventthe fermion from being on-shell, and could be an indi-cation of confinement [888, 889].31 More recently how-30 The CP vertex [884] is a nonperturbative Ansatz for theelectron-photon vertex that satifsies the Ward–Takahashi Iden-tity.
31 PM: My interest in the fermion DSE started with my Mas-ters research in the late 80s, with the question whether or notthere was a dynamical mass generation in (2+1)-dimensionalQED. In addition to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking,QED3 also exhibits confinement; these two features make itan illustrative toy model for QCD. Consistent treatment of thephoton propagator turns out to be crucial in QED3: in thequenched approximation (no fermion loops, and hence no vac-uum polatization), there is a logarithmically rising potentialbetween a fermion and anti-fermion. This logarithmically con-fining potential persist in the presence of massive fermion loopsin the vacuum polarization, but with massless fermions, thisconfining potential disappears. With the coupled DSEs for thefermion and photon propagator, it was found that there is acritical number of fermion flavors of aboutNf ∼ 3 to 4, below124 5 APPROXIMATE QCDever, is has been shown that, with proper regulariza-tion of potentially divergent integrals (e.g. using Pauli–Villars), that at least in weak-coupling quenched QED,the DSE for the electron propagator has the expectedanalytic structure, namely a mass-pole in the timelikeregion. This was obtained both in Feynman gauge andin Landau gauge; and using two independent numeri-cal methods, explicitly rotating the spacelike region tothe timelike region and using the Nakanishi formalism[890].
In QCD however, quarks (and gluons) are confined,and the quark propagator need not have a mass-pole attimelike momenta. A convenient way to study this is touse the Schwinger function,∆(t), defined by∆s,v(t) =∫d3x∫ d4p(2π)4 ei(tp4+⃗ x·⃗ p)σs,v(p2)= 1π∫ ∞0dp4 cos(tp4)σs,v(p24) ≥0 (5.3.12)where σs,v(p2) is the scalar or vector part of the dressedquark propagator,S(p) = i/pσv(p2) + σs(p2) . (5.3.13)For a propagator with a real mass-pole in the timelikeregion, this Schwinger function falls off like an exponen-tial. In contrast, a propagator with a pair of complex-conjugate mass-like singularities, the Schwinger func-tion is not positive-definite and exhibits an oscillatorybehavior∆(t) ∼e−at cos(bt+ δ) . (5.3.14)In Ref. [881] a striking qualitative difference betweentheuse ofa barequark-gluon vertexand theBC[ 891]orCP vertex was found: with a bare vertex, the Schwingerfunction behaves like a pair of complex-conjugate mass-like poles for the quark propagator, whereas the resultswith the BC and the CP vertex behave like a real mass-pole in the timelike region. Qualitatively similar resultswere found employing different models for the effectiverunning coupling, including (3+1) dimensional QED.
The existence of a pair of complex-conjugate mass-likesingularities in the DSE solutions of the dressed quarkpropagator in rainbow truncation was also confirmedby direct analytic continuation of the quark DSE intothe complex-momentum plane; the obtained real andimaginary parts of these singularities agree with thosewhich there is both dynamical mass generation and a confin-ing potential. Furthermore, it was found that in the presence ofthe logarithmically confining potential, the fermion propagatorexhibits a pair of ’mass-like’ singularities at complex conjugatemomenta in the complex momentum plane, whereas in the ab-sence of this logarithmically confining potential, the fermionpropagator appears to have a real mass-pole at timelike mo-memta, as one would expect based on perturbation theory.
extracted from the Schwinger function. Whether or notconfinement is realized through the absence of mass-like singularities on the real timelike axis remains to beseen. Note that these results are not inconsistent withthe CST, which assumes the existence of real quarkmass poles.
5.3.4 Pions: Goldstone bosons of QCDPions, and to some extent also kaons, are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons of QCD: in the chiral limit,mq = 0 ,chiral symmetry is broken dynamically, which impliestheexistenceofmasslessGoldstonebosons.IntheflavorSU(2) chiral limit, there are three Goldstone bosons(three pions); and in the flavor SU(3) chiral limit, therewould be eight Goldstone bosons. In the real world,the up, down, and strange quarks are not massless, buthave a small current quark masses; in addition, one ofthe eight ‘would-be’ Goldstone bosons mixes with theisoscalar pseudoscalar meson (which is massive due tothe axial anomaly) to form theη and η′. This explainsqualitatively why the three pions and four kaons are somuchlighterthanallothermesons,amongotherthings.
Therefore, in order to describe pions (and kaons), anytruncation has to respect all constraints coming fromchiral symmetry. Furthermore, it implies that the pionBSA is closely related to the (dynamically generated)scalar part of the quark self-energy, which can be madeexplicit by using the AV-WTI [892].
The axial-vector vertexΓµ5 satisfies a DSE as illus-trated in the second row of Fig.5.3.1, with an inhomo-geneus termγ5γµ. But even without solving the DSE,one can relate this vertex directly to the dressed quarkpropagators via the AV-WTIPµΓµ5 (p; P) = S−1(p2)γ5 + γ5S−1(p1)−2 mq(µ) Γ5(p; P) , (5.3.15)where Γ5(p; P) is the pseudoscalar vertex, which alsosatisfies a DSE as shown in Fig.5.3.1, with inhomoge-neous term γ5. This can be compared to the more fa-miliar vector WTI for the quark-photon vertex (whichsatisfies the same DSE with inhomogeneous termγµ),PµΓµ(p; P) = S−1(p2) −S−1(p1) (5.3.16)which ensures electromagnetic current conservation.
Meson poles in the quark-antiquark scattering am-plitude, G4, also appear in these vertices, depending ontheir quantum numbers. For the quark-photon vertexthis automatically leads to Vector Meson Dominance(VMD), a model for the coupling of photons to hadronsthat predates QCD [893] (see below). In the case of theaxial-vector vertex, near a pseudoscalar meson pole at5.3 DS/BS equations 125ˆP2 = −M2PS, we have32Γµ5 (p; P) ≈ ΓPS(p; ˆP)P2 + M2PSZ2Nc∫ d4k(2π)4 Tr[χPS(k; ˆP) γ5 γµ]= ΓPS(p; ˆP)P2 + M2PSfPS ˆPµ (5.3.17)with fPS the pseudoscalar decay constant, which gov-erns the coupling of a pseudoscalar meson to the axial-vector current.
Similarly, pseudoscalar mesons appear as poles inthe pseudoscalar vertex, and near ˆP2 = −M2PS thisvertex behaves asΓ5(p; P) ≈ ΓPS(p; ˆP)P2 + M2PSZ4Nc∫ d4k(2π)4 Tr[χPS(k; ˆP) γ5]= ΓPS(p; ˆP)P2 + M2PSrPS(µ) (5.3.18)withrPS(µ) the(renormalization-scaledependent)residuein the pseudoscalar channel. The AV-WTI relates theresidues at these polesfPS M2PS = −2 mq(µ) rPS(µ) , (5.3.19)which holds for any pseudoscalar meson. Therefore, inthe chiral limit,mq(µ) = 0 , eitherfPS or MPS must bezero. (If they are both zero, chiral symmetry will notbe dynamically broken; see below.)Furthermore, expanding the AV-WTI in powers ofM2PS in the chiral limit,mq(µ) = 0 , and using the mostgeneral Dirac decomposition ofΓPS 33ΓPS(k; ˆP) = γ5[iE+ /ˆPF + /kG + σµνkµˆPνH](5.3.20)one finds, to leading order inMPS,fPSE(p; 0) = B(p2) (5.3.21)where B(p) is the scalar part of the quark self-energy.
Thus,ifchiralsymmetryisdynamicallybroken,thatis, if mq(µ) = 0 but B(p2) ̸= 0 , fPS is nonzero, seeEq. (5.3.21), and pions necessarily emerge as masslessGoldstone bosons, see Eq. (5.3.19). Furthermore, thepseudoscalar component of the pion BSA is proportion-ally to the (dynamically generated) scalar self-energy ofthe quarks. In addition, the AV-WTI implies that thedecay constant of excited pions (which necessarily havenonzero mass) has to vanish in the chiral limit.
These relations are exact, and the asymptotic be-havior of the canonical pion BSA component can be ob-tained from the asymptotic behavior of the mass func-tions shown in Fig.5.3.6. The same asymptotic behav-ior of the canonical BSA component also holds with32 Remember we are using Euclidean metric here.

nonzero current quark masses; as well as for excitedpseudoscalar mesons.
Finally, with the definition ofrPS implicitly given inEq. (5.3.18, and the relation (5.3.21), we arrive at thewell-known Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner relationf2πm2π = 2 mq(µ) ⟨¯qq⟩µchiral , (5.3.22)with the chiral condensate⟨¯qq⟩µchiral = Z4Nc∫ d4k(2π)44 Bchiral(k2)k2A2(k2) + B2chiral(k2).(5.3.23)Note that the renormalization scale dependence of thecurrent quark mass,mq(µ), exactly cancels that of thechiral condensate.
5.3.5 Mesons in Rainbow-Ladder (RL) trunca-tionDifferent types of mesons, such as pseudoscalar (pions,kaons) or vector mesons (ρ, φ), are obtained by consid-ering the most general Dirac and flavor (isospin) struc-ture for the meson of interest, and solving the BSE,Eq. 5.3.1, at the bound state pole34.
To obtain practical solutions from the exact BSE,Eq.5.3.1, the kernelKmust be truncated; furthermore,one needs to approximate the dressed quark propaga-tors. The most commonly used truncation is the laddertruncation, in which the BSE kernelK in Eq. (5.3.1) isreplaced by an one-gluon exchange (or, in the case ofQED, a one-photon exchange)Kij(p,k; ˆP) Oi ⊗Oj →4πα(q2) Dfreeµν (q)λi2 γµ ⊗λi2 γν, (5.3.24)with a model for the effective running couplingα(q2).
Here we use the ladder truncation, in combination withquark propagators that are the solution of the DSEin rainbow truncation – hence we refer to it as theRainbow-Ladder (RL) truncation.
The resulting approximate BSE is solved numeri-cally, starting from the Euclidean metric, and analyt-ically continuing ˆP2 to negative values while keepingthe integration variable Euclidean. This leads to com-plex momenta for the quark propagators, which is triv-ial with bare constituent propagators; it is also well-defined and straightforward to implement for (nonper-turbatively) dressed propagators as long as there are nosingularities in either the (dressed) propagators or themodel for the effective interaction over a well-defineddomain in the complex momentum plane, depending34 The bound state mass is not known a priori; therefore onehas to vary ˆP2 until one finds a solution. This is most conve-niently done by introducing a fictitious eigenvalueλin front ofthe LHS of Eq.5.3.1 to turn it into an eigenvalue problem, andsearch for a solution withλ= 1 by varying ˆP2.126 5 APPROXIMATE QCDon the meson mass, choice ofη, and choice of frame35– though one may have to solve the quark DSE numer-ically over this domain.
In the previous section we showed in detail that thepion is the Goldstone boson associated with chiral sym-metry breaking; it becomes massless in the chiral limit;and its canonical BSA component is given by the scalarself-energy of the quark. The ladder truncation by it-self, in combination with bare propagators, does notpreserve these features of the pion. However, the RLtruncation with consistent dressed quark propagatorsdoes preserve the Goldstone nature of the pion, whichone can prove analytically using Eq. 5.3.15 and per-forming a shift in integration variables.36The RL truncation has been used extensively overthe past 25 years, not only for pions, but also for otherquantum numbers, and both for light systems, heavysystems, and heavy-light systems. A commonly usedmodelfortheinteractionistheMaris–Tandymodel[ 876].
Thismodelisfiniteintheinfraredregion,withsufficientstrength for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, andagrees perfectly with pQCD forq2 >25 GeV2. The dy-namical mass function of the up/down quarks, strangequarks, and charm quarks were shown in Fig.5.3.6.
For the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons, con-sisting of u, d, and s quarks, we find excellent agree-ment with the experimental data, not only for the spec-trum, but also for the decay constants. For the charmedmesons (both charmonium, and heavy-light systems)we also find agreement with experiment, within our nu-merical precision which is dominated by the need tosolve the quark propagator over a large domain in thecomplex momentum plane. Results for axial-vector andscalar mesons are much less in agreement with experi-ment, but it is known that leading-order corrections tothe RL truncation are significantly larger in the axial-vector and scalar channels than in the pseudoscalar andvector channels. Furthermore, the scalar mesons are no-toriously difficult to describe, and are likely to have asignificant 4-quark content (in particular the broadσmeson, if it can be called a meson).
Meson form factors and scatteringWith the BSA we can evaluate a range of other phys-ical observables. We have already mentioned the elec-35 The BSA is frame independent, but in Euclidean metric,k · P is purely imaginary in the restframe (remember ˆP2 isnegative), and becomes generally complex in a moving frame.
It has been shown that physical observables are indeed frameindependent by solving the BSE in RL truncation explicitly ina moving frame [894].

Consider the elastic form factor of a meson:the right panel of Fig.5.3.5shows the coupling of a pho-tontoamesoninimpulseapproximation.Onecanshowanalytically that if one considers the dressed quark-photon vertex as the solution of its inhomogeneous BSEusing the same RL kernel as for the quark propagatorsand the meson BSE, current conservation is automat-ically guaranteed. Another advantage of using such adressed quark-photon vertex, instead of a bare vertex,is that vector meson poles will automatically appear aspoles atQ2 = −M2V in the dressed vertex; thus, VMDis unambiguously included in this approach [895].
A practical challenge is that at least one of themesons in Fig.5.3.5 has to be in a moving frame. Forsmall values ofQ2 one can use a Taylor expansion ofthe BSA in the rest frame, but explicitly solving theBSE in a moving frame greatly improves the accessi-ble domain inQ2 and reduces numerical uncertaintiesassociated with e.g. a Taylor expansion.

Similar diagrams can and have also been used forelectroweak transition form factors and the anomalousπ0 →2γ process [899]. One finds generally good agree-ment with experimental data, thanks to the fact thatthis approach satisfies all constraints coming from elec-tromagnetic current conservation, chiral symmetry, anddynamical chiral symmetry breaking; furthermore, it5.3 DS/BS equations 127+ + + ++ + + +Fig. 5.3.8 RL truncation forγ3π consistent with chiral sym-metry and electromagnetic current conservations: quark propa-gators, vertices and box-diagram all dressed with the same RLkernel (adapted from [900]).
includes unambigously VMD effects, and it also agreeswith perturbative QCD at large momenta. This is notto say that there are no short-comings in this approach:obviously there is physics beyond the RL truncationthat is important, some of which are discussed below.
More challenging are scattering observables involv-ing four external mesons and/or electroweak probes.
Based on the success of describing form factors in im-pulse approximation, one might consider just the boxdiagram with dressed vertices and propagators for suchprocesses. However, it turns out that this is insufficient,and does not reproduce the expected results for e.g.
ππ scattering or γ3π coupling – which are both con-strained by chiral symmetry. For a consistent descrip-tion of scattering observables involving four externalprobes, one needs to include the same RL kernel in-side the box diagram as well, resummed to all orders,as indicated in Fig.5.3.8. With these ladder diagramsadded to the box diagram, it has been shown explicitlythatboththeanomalous γ3πprocess[ 900]and ππscat-tering [901] are in perfect agreement with chiral sym-metry and electromagnetic current conservation. Thesame approach can in principle also be used for otherprocesses, involving other mesons, and it would be veryinteresting to extend this approach in the future to e.g.
Compton scattering on hadrons, as well as pion-nucleonscattering.
5.3.6 Beyond the RL approximationOver the past two decades significant progress has beenmade in improving the RL truncation while preservingthe relevant vector and axial-vector WTIs [875, 902,903]. Although the details of these investigations differ,the general conclusion is that corrections beyond RLarerelativelysmallinthepseudoscalarandvectorchan-nels, but can be significantly larger in the axial-vectorsand scalar channels. This makes it understandable whythe pseudoscalar and vector meson masses and decay1.51.00.50.0+−0 −−1 ++0 −+1 ++1 −+0−−0 +−12PI-3L3PI-3LPDGҞ(1600)݉[ܸ݁ܩ]Ҟ(1260)ҝ(1450)ߩ1450)ߨ1300)ߨߩҞ(1235)Ҟ(1400)Fig. 5.3.9Light meson spectrum beyond RL truncation (Fig-ure adapted from [904]).

constants are in such good agreement with data, but atthe same time an accurate description of mesons withother quantum numbers requires going beyond RL.
One of the more promising methods to go beyondthe RL truncation is based on then-Particle Irreducible(n-PI) effective action, in particular the2-PI and3-PIeffective action up to 3 loops [830, 904]. This gener-ally leads to coupled integral equations for the quark,gluon, and ghost propagators, the quark-gluon vertex(and possibly other vertices), and possibly higher n-point functions. Computationally, solving these coupledsets of integral equations in multiple variables is signif-icantly more complicated and time consuming than theRL truncation, but with current (and future) compu-tational resources, the resulting integral equations canbe solved for selected cases. The spectrum obtained forthe light mesons (including the axial-vector mesons) isin good agreement with available data, see Fig.5.3.9;the only obvious disagreement is in the scalar channel,where pion loops play an important role.128 5 APPROXIMATE QCDHigher Fock componentsAlthough the RL truncation appears to be quite suc-cessful for a range of meson observables, it has its limi-tations. Consider the pion form factor: Fig.5.3.7 showsthis form factor in the spacelike region, but we can alsoextend these calculations to the timelike region. In thetimelike region, we find a pole atQ2 = −M2ρ; exactlyas one would expect, because we already know that thehomogeneous BSE for the vector channel has a solu-tion at ˆP2 = −M2ρ. However, this pole is above the2πthreshold – in the real world, this pole is shifted to thesecond Reimann sheet, and there is a resonance peakwith non-zero width atQ2 = −M2ρ. Indeed, incorpo-rating pion loops in the dressed quark-photon vertexin the timelike region changes the vector-meson poleto a resonance peak, and the resulting form factor isin good agreement with the data [905], see Fig.5.3.10.
Although the center of the peak is slightly shifted com-pared to the data, the peak height and width are ingood agreement with the data in the timelike regionSimilarly, pion loops are likely to be important forthe scalar mesons, which can be included by incorporat-ing configurations with two quarks and two anti-quarksin the BSE. This leads to a set of coupled equations be-tween the usual quark-antiquark components, as wellas ’meson-meson’ contributions and ’diquark-diquark’contributions. This has recently been implemented forthe scalar channel [906], which reveals that theσmesonis indeed dominated by two-pion contributions, as onemight expect. This approach will also be very useful toinvestigate exotic mesons, tetraquarks, and in the fu-ture also pentaquarks, all within the same framework.
5.3.7 BaryonsThe notion of diquarks has been around for almost aslong as QCD; see e.g. Ref. [756]. Initial DSE studies ofbaryons were therefore formulated in terms of boundstates of a quark and a diquark; specifically a scalarand an axialvector diquark.
However, as described in Sec.5.3.2, three fermionstates can also be described by a 3-body BSE, and in re-cent years there has been significant progress in describ-ing and understanding baryons as three-quark boundstates using the DSE with essentially the same RL ap-proximations as used for the mesons. An effective in-teraction is modeled using the Dirac structure of a one-gluon exchange between two quarks, see Eq.5.3.24, incombination with consistent nonperturbatively dressedquark propagators. Figure5.3.11 shows the calculatedspectrum for nucleons and delta resonances togetherwith the experimental spectrum. The results for theground state nucleons, as well as their radial excita-𝑀 [𝐺𝑒𝑉] 𝛥𝑁+21 −21 +21 −21−23+23 −23+23PDG \*\*q-dqqqqPDG \*\*\*PDG \*\*\*\*0.81.01.21.41.61.82.0Fig. 5.3.11 Baryon spectrum in RL truncation in the quark-diquark picture (blue bars) and as three-quark bound state(open boxes), compared to experimental spectrum (Figureadapted from [907]).
tions, are in good agreement with experiment, both inthe quark-diquark and the three-quark bound state pic-tures. For the other quantum numbers we see noticabledifferences between the quark-diquark and three-quarkbound state results (and note that not all quantumnumbers have been done as a three-quark bound state).
The obtained bound state amplitudes can be used forthe evaluation of nucleon form factors, see e.g. [907] andreferences therein, analogous to the calculation of thepion form factor discussed earlier.
5.3.8 ConclusionsAt the energy scales of mesons and barons, nonpertur-bative methods are needed, and the DSEs and BSE(or the CST) work very well. The main shortcoming ofthese methods is that the kernels needed to solve for theself energies of wave functions are unknown, and mustbe modeled. The combination of the ladder (L) trun-cation of the BSE with the closely related rainbow (R)truncation of the DSE for self energies are reasonablysuccessful, in particular in describing chiral symmetrybreakingandtheroleofthepionastheGoldstonebosonof QCD. The few calculations beyond the RL trunca-tion that exist show that the additional effects are notlarge, except in particular spin-isospin channels.
We expect this technique to develop in the yearsahead and to remain an attractive method for theoret-ical study of QCD.5.4 Light-front quantization 1295.4 Light-front quantizationJames V ary , Y ang Li, Chandan Mondaland Xingbo ZhaoIn this section, we discuss non-perturbative light-frontHamiltonian quantization methods. We primarily focuson introducing the Hamiltonians for QED and QCDderived in the light-cone gauge (for extensive reviews,see Refs [792, 908]). We introduce methods of solutionand results for mesons and baryons. We focus on theDiscretized Light Cone Quantization (DLCQ) and Ba-sis Light Front Quantization (BLFQ) methods due totheir ability to include gluons and sea quarks dynami-cally.
Light-front quantization is the natural language fordescribing the partonic degrees of freedom of QCD athigh energies. This connection has been extensively ex-ploited in phenomenological approaches to hard inclu-siveandexclusiveprocesses(seeSecs. 5.9,5.10).Intheseapproaches, instead of solving the QCD dynamics, thesymmetries and properties of QCD are employed toconstructphenomenologicalpartonicamplitudesorden-sities on the light front.
Before introducing specific light-front Hamiltonianmethods of solution, let us recap the key concepts ofthe light-front Hamiltonian approach that spring fromDirac’sformulationofPoincare’invariantquantumframe-works [909]. Our choice of light-front variables can besummarized in relation to equal-time variables by in-troducingP = (P0 +P3,P0 −P3,P⊥) = ( P+,M2 + (P⊥)2P+ ,P⊥),whereP andM represent the 4-momentum and mass ofthe hadron, respectively. For the hadron’s constituents(quarks, antiquarks, gluons), which we refer to as par-tons, we adoptp⊥i as the transverse momentum of theith parton,xi = p+iP+ is its longitudinal momentum frac-tion,λi is its light-front helicity [910], and roman alpha-bet subscripts run through the partons of the hadron.
The Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem for the mass-squaredeigenstatesandtheirassociatedlight-frontwavefunctions (LFWFs) begins with defining the light-frontSchrödinger equation for the system’s eigenstates. Tak-ing P⊥ = 0 and H = P− (using dimensionless units forthe conservedP+)H|P,Λ⟩= M2 |P,Λ⟩ (5.4.1)where Λis the hadron’s light-front helicity andH con-tains kinetic, interaction and Lagrange multiplier termsH =∑ip⊥2i + m2ixi+ Hint + λCMHCM . (5.4.2)Here, the sum is over all partons andmi is the massof the ith parton. The role of the Lagrange multiplierterm ensures factorization of the state vector’s trans-verse component into an internal, boost invariant, com-ponent times a center of mass (CM) component [911].
We note that this eigenvalue problem applies to sys-tems with arbitrary baryon number so that, for exam-ple, it applies to atomic nuclei as well. An eigenstateof a system can be written in terms of a Fock-spaceexpansion over sectors withN-partons as|P,Λ⟩=∑N∑λ1,...,λN∫ ∏Ni=1 dxidp⊥i[2(2π)N]2 √x1xNδ(1 −N∑i=1xi)×δ2(N∑i=1p⊥i )ψΛ{λi}N({pi}N) |{λi,pi}N⟩, (5.4.3)where ψΛλ1,...,λN(p1,...,p N) is the light-front helicityamplitudeforeachcomponent.Eachofthemulti-partonbasis states |{λi,pi}N⟩ is defined as a properly nor-malized string of N fermion, anti-fermion and gluoncreation operators acting on the vacuum. Eq.5.4.3 isschematic since, for fixedN, there can be many sub-cases with the same net fermion number. We note thatthe kinetic term in Eq.5.4.2 is diagonal in this multi-parton basis. In the following sections, we introduce thediscretized and basis function alternatives to Eq.5.4.3.
Forgaugetheories,atraditionalapproachistoadoptthe light-front gauge,A+ = 0, and to reduce the Hamil-tonian to the minimum number of dynamical degrees offreedom using constraint equations. For QED and QCDthis produces the Hint term of Eq.5.4.2 expressed interms of Pauli spinors with the boson-fermion vertices(QED and QCD) as well as boson-boson vertices (QCDonly). In addition to these vertices, the gauge-fixingand reduction procedures lead to higher-order instan-taneous interactions which manifest divergences. Theresulting 3(7) vertices for QED [72](QCD [912, 913])are deceptively simple and are shown in Fig.5.4.1Like its Lagrangian counterpart, Hamiltonian fieldtheory needs to be regularized and renormalized. Di-mensional regularization is only available for pertur-bative calculations. In non-perturbative solutions, theinvariant mass cutoff and the Pauli-Villars regulariza-tion are often adopted. Since non-perturbative eigen-value problems have to be solved numerically, finitediscretization schemes are also needed. One can chooseto use the discretization to define the regularization.
DLCQ and BLFQ are such schemes. Alternatively, thediscretizationcanbeusedpurelyasthenumericalmethod.

See [792]for a recent review. Solid lines represent fermions (vertices withantifermions are obtained by reversing a fermion line) and wavylines represent gauge bosons. A graph that includes a fermionor boson with a horizontal line through it represents an in-stantaneous interaction term. Though one LF time ordering ispictured (increasing LF time flows to the right), all allowed LFtime orderings are included inHint. Thus, for example, an in-coming line can be switched to an outgoing line at any vertexand vice-versa.
be extended to this scheme, as realized in Fock sectordependent renormalization [914].
Thesimilarityrenormalizationgroup(SRG)approachis another non-perturbative approach based on Wil-son’srenormalizationgroupevolution[ 915,916].Thanksto asymptotic freedom, the SRG transformation can beevaluated perturbatively up to some scale, say, a fewGeV. Different schemes were designed for implement-ing SRG, notably the Bloch-Wilson formulation [917]and the renormalization group procedure for effectiveparticles (RGPEP [918]). An RGPEP effective Hamil-tonian for heavy flavor hadrons is derived using a gluonmass ansatz [919]. In the gluon sector, it successfullyreproduces asymptotic freedom in the 3-gluon effectivevertex [920].
The Fock space expansion (Eq.5.4.3) provides themost straightforward representation of the eigenvalueproblem Eq. 5.4.1. Within this basis, the eigenvalueequation becomes an infinite tower of coupled integralequations.Theintegrationscanbeevaluatedusingstan-dardnumericaltechniques;however,truncationisneededto obtain numerical solutions. The situation is similarto the Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter equations ap-proach in the covariant formulation (see Sec.5.3). Thelight-frontTamm-Dancoffapproximation(LFTDA)trun-cates the Fock sections in terms of the particle number[921]. LFTDA can be systematically renormalized us-ing the Fock sector dependent renormalization [914].
This was used to investigate various theories withinfew-body truncation (see Ref. [908] for a review). Typ-ically, the convergence of the Fock sector expansioncan be checked numerically [922], although the numeri-cal complexity increases dramatically as the number ofFock sectors increases. The light-front coupled clustermethod was proposed to improve the convergence andpathology associated the hard Fock sector truncationby adopting a coherent basis [923].
Another major development in light-front quanti-zation is the discovery of the remarkable connectionbetween light-front dynamics, its holographic mappingto gravity in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS)space, and conformal quantum mechanics, known aslight-frontholography(LFH).Thisapproachintroducesa remarkably simple yet universal confining potential,which underlines the various phenomenological appli-cations in light-front QCD. See Sec.5.5 for details.
5.4.1 Discretized Light-Cone QuantizationWhile lattice calculations (see Sec. 4) solve QCD inEuclidean spacetime, DLCQ formulates the problem di-rectly in Minkowski spacetime using a discretized mo-mentum basis (see Ref [792] and references therein).
In DLCQ, one defines a mesh in momentum spacethat corresponds to standing waves in a box of lengthLin each transverse direction and a similar set of modesin the longitudinal direction. Either periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions are applied. Early ap-plications of DLCQ to gauge theories included solv-ing QED for positronium at strong coupling [924].Sim-ilarly, early successes include solving QCD in 1+1 di-mensions[925].MovingtoQCDin3+1dimensionswithDLCQ revealed formal and numerical challenges butproducedmanyvaluableresultsasreviewedinRef.[ 908].
A hybrid light-front DLCQ/lattice formulation wasintroduced and employed to evaluate parton distribu-tion functions for a sample set of meson states over arange of coupling strengths [926, 927]. These applica-tions of DLCQ motivated the quest for an approachthat both preserves the LF kinematic symmetries andprovides a computational path with improved numeri-cal efficiency.
5.4.2 Basis Light F ront QuantizationThe quest to develop LF Hamiltonian approaches inMinkowski-spacethatretainallavailablekinematicsym-metries began with adoption of basis function methodsfor solving light front wave equations [928]. Later, the5.4 Light-front quantization 131BLFQ approach [929] was introduced to treat gaugetheory Hamiltonians using basis-functions that satisfiedvery general mathematical conditions and respected theLFkinematicsymmetries.Inaddition,theBLFQframe-work is well-suited for a longer-term goal of developingbasis functions that approximated anticipated dynam-ical features of QCD such as confinement and chiralsymmetry breaking for applications to hadron spectra.
Such basis functions have the promise of facilitatingconvergence in non-perturbative LF QCD calculations.
In BLFQ, one introduces an alternative to the mo-mentum space representation of the LF eigenstate pre-sented in Eq.5.4.3. Instead of working with LF planewaves, BLFQ introduces a superposition of orthonor-mal N-parton Fock space states expressed as indepen-dent partons in some convenient orthonormal single-parton basis. That is, we replace the conventional quan-tization in terms of LF plane waves with LF quantiza-tioninmodesofasolvablesingle-partonLFSchrödingerequation akin to Eq.5.4.1. Thus, the LF many-partonbasis states can be written as strings of fermion, an-tifermion and boson creation operators that populateindependent modes of the single-parton LF Schrödingerequation. All applications described below elect the 2DHarmonic Oscillator for the transverse modes owing tothe ability to preserve transverse boost invariance. Thischoice is further motivated by holographic light-frontQCD (see Sec.5.5 for details) and has been our defaultchoice for practical calculations. For the longitudinalmodes there have been a number of choices includingDLCQ. In principle, the basis is arbitrary within gen-eral mathematical restrictions so convenience and nu-merical efficiency are the key drivers for the choicesrepresented in applications to date.
Let us label the set of quantum numbers for eachsingle-parton mode with a lower-case Greek letter. ThisGreek label symbolizes the collection of all space-spin-color-flavor degrees of freedom of a single parton inQCD. Fermion and boson single-parton states are or-thonormal and complete. Their creation operators sat-isfy the conventional anti-commutation (commutation)relations for fermions (bosons).
In BLFQ, an eigenstate of a system can then bewritten in terms of a Fock-space expansion over sectorswith N-partons as|P,Λ⟩=∑N∑{αi}NψΛ{αi}N |{αi}N,Λ⟩. (5.4.4)where the inner sum includes all allowed configurationsofN-partonssatisfyingglobalsymmetryconstraintssuchas baryon number, charge, total helicity projection onthe x− direction, total LF momentum, flavor, etc. Forstates with two or more bosons, an additional factor isapplied to maintain normalization when bosons occupythe same mode.
Up to this point, the Hamiltonian eigenvalue prob-lem of Eq.5.4.1 is infinite dimensional in both the num-ber of single-parton modes and the number of Focksectors. With a well-chosen BLFQ single-parton basis(see Sec. 5.4.7 for recent advances) and the verticesof QCD from Fig.5.4.1, one hopes to achieve reason-able bound state properties with practical cutoffs inthese sums suitable for low-resolution applications ofQCD for spectra, electoweak transitions, form factorsat low-Q2, etc.
5.4.3 BLFQ with QED applicationsEarly applications of BLFQ aimed at solving strongcoupling QED problems in order to establish compu-tational techniques and validate BLFQ for achievingconverged results in agreement with other methods.
These test cases were demanding since they employedthe transverse 2D harmonic oscillator and DLCQ forthe longitudinal direction to form a basis space that,while suitable for bound state problems in QCD, is farfrom ideal for these QED applications.
The first application successfully solved for the elec-tron anomalous magnetic moment in an external 2Dharmonic trap and took the limit of removing the trapto verify agreement with the well-known Schwinger re-sult [930]. For this application, the first and second ver-tices in Fig. 5.4.1 are included and sector-dependentrenormalization [914] was successfully employed.
The next major advance successfully calculated theelectron anomalous magnetic moment directly in freespace and at the physical coupling [931, 932] using thesame LF Hamilonian and renormalization proceduresas Ref. [930] except that the instantaneous vertex wasomitted. The demands on the numerical procedures in-creased dramatically due, in large part, to the slow con-vergence rate with increasing basis cutoff. The extrap-olated result agrees with the Schwinger result to within0.06% which approximately corresponds to the level ofagreement expected between a non-perturbative and aperturbative calculation.
Movingaheadfromtheseearlyapplications,thegoalsof BLFQ were extended to evaluate additional observ-ables familiar to hadronic physics using the resultingLFWFs. In particular, the BLFQ approach was ap-plied to evaluate the GPDs [933] and the TMDs of thedressed electron [934]. In all cases, the non-perturbativeBLFQ results compared favorably with results fromperturbation theory at weak coupling.
The next major application was to solve for thelow-lying spectrum of positronium at strong coupling132 5 APPROXIMATE QCD11111111111111111111111JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ1 1 1 1 11.97 1.975 1.98 1.985 1.99 1.995 22.005 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 Mass/m fµ /mf11S013S123P2α =0.3Fig. 5.4.2Positronium spectrum extracted from a BLFQ cal-culation of QED with an unphysically large couplingα = 0 .3[935].

Theapplication of BLFQ to positronium adopted the LFeffective one-photon exchange interaction of Ref. [941],where they achieved a delicate cancellation of the in-stantaneous photon interaction term through a suitablechoice of energy denominators in second order pertur-bation theory. These calculations were performed in thefermionsingle-particlebasiswiththe2Dtransversehar-monic oscillator and DLCQ for the longitudinal basis.
Convergence was achieved directly inK and by extrap-olation inNmax, the regulators introduced above. Theresults for the lowest bound states of positronium as afunction of the photon regulator mass are shown in Fig.
5.4.2. At zero regulator mass, one obtains good agree-ment with results from perturbation theory. The result-ing LFWFs were employed to demonstrate methods ofcalculating GPDs [942] and reveal relativistic effects instrongly-coupled positronium.
More recently, the BLFQ approach has been suc-cessfully applied to solve for the structure of the pho-ton [943].

Factorization of theCM motion from the LFWFs is addressed using the La-grange multiplier term in Eq.5.4.2 as was accomplishedin Ref. [935].

The data points aretaken from Ref. [970]side the proton [971]. The helicity non-flip unpolarizedGPD in impact parameter space,Hq(x,b⊥), can be in-terpreted as the number density of quarks with lon-gitudinal momentum fraction x at a given transversedistance b⊥ in the nucleon [972]. One can then definethe xdependent squared radius of the quark density inthe transverse plane as [970]:⟨b2⊥⟩q(x) =∫d2⃗b⊥b2⊥Hq(x,b⊥)∫d2⃗b⊥Hq(x,b⊥). (5.4.5)Figure 5.4.12 shows thex-dependent squared radius ofthe proton, ⟨b2⊥⟩(x) = 2 eu⟨b2⊥⟩u(x) + ed⟨b2⊥⟩d(x) andcompares the BLFQ prediction with the available ex-tracted data within the range0.05 ≲ x≲ 0.2 from theDVCS process [970]. As can be seen from Fig.5.4.12,the BLFQ prediction for⟨b2⊥⟩(x) is consistent with theextracted data. We also evaluated the proton’s trans-verse squared radius [970]⟨b2⊥⟩=∑qeq∫ 10dxfq(x) ⟨b2⊥⟩q(x). (5.4.6)In our BLFQ approach, we obtained the squared ra-dius of the proton,⟨b2⊥⟩= 0.40 ±0.04 fm2, close to theexperimental data [970]: ⟨b2⊥⟩exp = 0.43 ±0.01 fm2.
BLFQ has been recently applied to investigate theall-charm tetraquark system [973]. The results suggestthat the lowest two-charm-two-anticharm state is nota tightly bound tetraquark. In particular, the lowesttetraquark mass extrapolated to the continuum limitin longitudinal resolutionK lies above the extrapolatedthreshold for two separated mesons.
5.4.5 BLFQ beyond the valence F ock sectorIn this section, we review more recent applications ofBLFQ with the inclusion of dynamical gauge degrees offreedom: to positronium at strong coupling (α = 0 .3)with one dynamical photon earlier in DLCQ [974] andnow in BLFQ [975, 976]; to mesons with one dynami-cal gluon [896] and to the proton with one dynamicalgluon [961].
For the BLFQ application to QED, the positroniumsystem with one dynamical photon presents valuablechallenges with respect to non-perturbative renormal-ization [975–977]. The dynamics of the single fermionsystem must first be obtained and then embedded inthe positronium system with consistent counting of thebasis space quanta. That is, within a given Fock sectorof positronium and within a given configuration, thedistribution of quanta for that configuration dictatesthe renormalized mass of the fermion to be applied andthe basis space in which that mass was determined.5.4 Light-front quantization 137With this dynamical approach, the leading self-energydivergence is taken into account which opens a path toproceed to larger basis spaces.
GoingbeyondtheleadingFockcomponentforQCD,BLFQ has been successfully employed to solve the un-flavored light mesons and nucleon with one dynamicalgluon [896, 961]. In particular, we adopted an effectivelight-front Hamiltonian and solved for their mass eigen-values and eigenstates at the scales suitable for low-resolution probes. Our Hamiltonian incorporates light-front QCD interactions [792] relevant to constituent|q¯q⟩and |q¯qg⟩Fock sectors of the mesons and |qqq⟩and |qqqg⟩Fock sectors of the nucleon with a comple-mentary 3D confinement [950]. By solving this Hamil-tonian in the leading two Fock components and fittingthe constituent parton masses and coupling constantsasthemodelparameters[ 896],weobtainedagoodqual-ity description of light meson mass spectroscopy[896].
We computed the pion electromagnetic form fac-tor and the PDFs from our Hamiltonian’s LFWFs. TheBLFQ prediction of the electromagnetic form factor ofthe charged pion is compared with the experimentaldata in Fig. 5.3.7 in Sec. 5.3. Figure 5.4.8 shows ourresults for the pion PDFs and compares the valencequark distribution after QCD evolution with the datafrom the E615 experiment as well as the reanalysis ofthe E615 experiment. The pion PDFs previously ob-tained in BLFQ-NJL model [948, 957, 959] based on avalence Fock representation have also been included forcomparison. The error bands in our evolved PDFs aremanifested from an adopted10% uncertainty in our ini-tial scale,µ20 = 0.34 ±0.03 GeV2, which we determinedby requiring the result after evolution to generate thetotal first moments of the valence quark and the valenceantiquark distributions from the global QCD analysis,⟨x⟩valence = 0.48±0.01 at µ2 = 5 GeV2 [978]. We founda good agreement between our prediction for the pionvalencequarkPDFandthereanalyzedE615data,whilethe BLFQ-NJL model favours the original E615 data.
The lower panel of Fig.5.4.8 shows the gluon PDFin the pion. Including one dynamical gluon, the gluondensity in the pion significantly increases compared tothat in the BLFQ-NJL model as well as to the globalfits [979]. The BLFQ-NJL model is based on the pionvalence Fock component and gluons are produced solelyfrom the scale evolution. However, the model, whichincludes a dynamical gluon at the initial scale, resultsin a larger gluon PDF at large-x (> 0.2) after scaleevolution.
We produced the unpolarized and polarized valencequark and gluon distributions in the proton using theresulting LFWFs for the proton with one dynamicalgluon. We evolved our initial PDFs from the modelscale, µ20 = 0 .23 ∼ 0.25 GeV2, to the relevant ex-perimental scales. The blue bands in Figures 5.4.10and 5.4.11 show our results for the proton unpolar-ized and polarized PDFs, respectively. We obtained agood consistency between our prediction for the valencequark PDFs and the global fits. The ratiodv(x)/uv(x)reasonably agrees with the extracted data from theMARATHON experiment at JLab [980]. At the end-point, we predicted thatlimx→1 dv/uv = 0.225 ±0.025.
We found that the down quark unpolarized PDFfalls off at large x as (1 −x)3.5±0.1, whereas for theup quark PDF exhibits(1 −x)3.2±0.1. These findingssupport the perturbative QCD prediction [968]. We ob-served that the gluon PDF is suppressed at small-xandshiftstowardstheglobalfits[ 627,981]withtheadditionof a dynamical gluon, whereas the PDF forx >0.05agrees with the global fits.
Our helicity PDFs for both the up and down quarks(Fig.5.4.11:upperpanel)arereasonablyconsistentwiththe experimental data from COMPASS [969]. We no-ticed that the up quark polarized PDF improves signif-icantly at small-xregion with the treatment for the nu-cleon with dynamical gluon. We observed a fair agree-ment between our prediction for the gluon helicity PDF(Fig. 5.4.11: lower panel) and the global analyses bythe JAM [982] and the NNPDF Collaborations [983].
Note that there still remain huge uncertainties both inthe large-x region and especially in the small-x region,where even the sign is uncertain. [984]. The partonicspin contributions to the proton spin are given by thefirst moment of the polarized PDFs. We found that thegluon carries 26% of the proton spin [961], which islikely to increase when more dynamical gluons are in-cluded.
5.4.6 F ull BLFQThe applications of BLFQ to hadron structures demon-strated so far have adopted explicit Fock sector trun-cations. The incorporation of a dynamical gauge boson(Sec. 5.4.5) has shown promising improvements in com-parison with valence Fock sector only. A major nextstep is the full BLFQ [929], in which the Hamiltoni-ans are solved non-perturbatively with basis regulatorsonly and without additional Fock space truncation. Theelimination of the additional Fock space truncation po-sitions BLFQ on the path to a genuineab initio ap-proach to QCD. Initial applications which qualify asfull BLFQ include solving scalar 1+1 D field theorieswithout Fock space truncation [985].
The full BLFQ is posed as a quantum many-bodyproblem while the number of partons is not fixed. Thesingle-particle harmonic oscillator basis with the lon-138 5 APPROXIMATE QCDgitudinal discretized momentum basis is the preferredchoice of basis, together with theNmax-K regulariza-tion,∑i[2ni + |mi|+ 1] ≤Nmax,∑ip+i = 2πKL .
(5.4.7)Assuch,allkinematicalsymmetriesoftheLFQCDHamil-tonian, including the the factorization of the center-of-mass motion, are preserved in the many-body Hilbertspace. This basis corresponds to a pair of soft IR & UVresolutions and a collinear resolution,b2/(Nmax −1) ≲∑ik2i⊥xi≲ b2(Nmax −1), (5.4.8)∆x≳ K−1. (5.4.9)Here, b =√P+Ω. P+ is the longitudinal momentumof the bound state. Ω is the scale parameter of thetransverse harmonic oscillator functions. Note that, ifzero modes are omitted as is conventional, theNmax-Kregularization renders the number of partons finite, andno further Fock sector truncation is needed.
A fundamental challenge of the full BLFQ is the ex-ponential increase of the dimensionality of the Hilbertspace, dim H= NdN, (N = max {Nmax,K}), a prop-ertysharedbyallstrongcouplingnon-perturbativequan-tum many-body problems. Nevertheless, meaningful re-sults may be achievable with continuing advances inhigh-performance computers at and beyond exascale(1018 floatingpointoperationspersecond).Ontheotherhand, future quantum computers offer the promise toprovide supremacy over even the best high-performancecomputers, in particular for non-perturbative quantummany-body problems such as posed by full BLFQ [986].
5.4.7 BLFQ with chiral symmetry breakingDue to the light quark mass, m{u,d} ≪ Λqcd, chiralsymmetry plays an important role on the light me-son spectrum and structures. In particular, the pion isthe Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken chi-ral symmetry. Formally, chiral symmetry implies a par-tially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC). In BSE,this relation leads to a set of relations between the pionBethe-Salpeter amplitudes and the quark self-energy(see Sec.5.3). Recently, it was revealed that PCAC alsoleads to a chiral sum rule for the pion LFWFs [987].
It was long pointed out that chiral symmetry break-ing in LFQCD is manifested in a different way fromthe instant form (see Ref. [988] for a recent review). Inthe instant form, chiral symmetry breaking is due tothe condensate of quark-antiquark, viz.⟨¯qq⟩̸= 0 . Thelight-front vacuum is trivial due to the positivity of thelongitudinal momenta. Therefore, the vacuum conden-sate on the light front can only happen through the zeromodes. Indeed, the wee parton condensate is long con-jectured to be the mechanism for symmetry breakingon the light front, which is supported by 1+1D theoriesand has shown to be a useful starting point for BLFQapplications [989].
On the other hand, the axial charge on the lightfront annihilates the light-front vacuum, Q5|0⟩ = 0 ,which suggests that the chiral condensate should be en-codedwithinthehadronLFWFs[ 990].Oneofthetracesof the chiral symmetry breaking in the pion LFWFs isthe chiral sum rule [987]. Taking advantage of light-front holography, this sum rule has been shown to bealso consistent with the chiral symmetry breaking inAdS/QCD.
5.4.8 Nonperturbative reactions in BLFQOne major advantage of the Hamiltonian formalism ofquantum field theory is that it allows for tracking timeevolution of quantum field configurations in real time.
As an extension of BLFQ, the time-dependent Ba-sis Light-front Quantization (tBLFQ) has been devel-oped as a time-dependent nonperturbative approach toquantum field theory [991]. In tBLFQ the light-frontSchrödinger equation is solved to simulate the time evo-lution of quantum field configurations:i ∂∂x+⏐⏐ψ; x+⟩= 12P−(x+)⏐⏐ψ; x+⟩, (5.4.10)where |ψ; x+⟩represents the quantum field system un-der consideration andP−(x+) is the light-front Hamil-tonian, which includes the interactions among the fieldsunder consideration. The tBLFQ approach is suitablefor studying particle evolution in a strong and possiblytime-dependentbackgroundfield.ThetBLFQapproachmotivated a nonperturbative approach simulating nu-clear reactions in low energy nuclear physics, namedtime-dependent Basis Function (tBF) [992].
One of the major goals of tBLFQ is to understandthe nonperturbative dynamics in QCD, as in hadronscattering. The investigations of quark scattering witha nucleus constitute a first step toward this goal. InRef. [993], tBLFQ is employed to simulate the scat-tering of an ultrarelativistic quark off a heavy nucleusat high energies. The color glass condensate, a classi-cal effective theory of QCD, is adopted as a model forthe color field of the heavy nucleus. The results cansignificantly reduce the theoretical uncertainties in thesmall p⊥ region of the differential cross section which5.5 AdS/QCD and light-front holography 139Fig. 5.4.13The evolution of the transverse density of a quarkwithin a classical color field of a heavy nucleus at different light-front timex+. The four “snapshots” are from Ref. [993]has important implications for the phenomenology ofthe hadron-nucleus and deep inelastic scattering at highenergies. One important feature of tBLFQ is that it al-lows one to take “snapshots” of the system at inter-mediate times of the evolution, which provide physicalinsights into the nonperturbative mechanism in time-dependent processes. For example, Fig. 5.4.13 showsthe evolution of the probability distribution of a quarkin the transverse direction at different light-front timesx+. In Ref. [995] a calculation is performed in an ex-tended Fock space where one dynamical gluon is in-cluded, which paves the way for studying partons’ ra-diational energy loss in nuclear matter.
In addition to the applications in QCD, tBLFQ hasalso been employed to study various nonperturbativeprocesses in strong field QED [991, 996–999].
The tBLFQ approach can be further improved inthree directions: i) increase in the level of complexityand realism of the background field: ii) expansion toreaction processes of a wider class; iii) the expansionof the Fock space in the description of quantum fieldconfigurations. While this can lead to more accuratesimulation of dynamical processes, it will dramaticallyincrease the required computational resources. There-fore, it is desirable to explore numerical algorithms fortBLFQonnext-generationadvancedcomputationalplat-forms.
5.4.9 Comparisons between BLFQ and BSEThe similarities and differences of the light-front andthe BSE (see Sec. 5.3) approaches motivate a directcomparison of the amplitudes obtained from these twoapproaches [870]. Fig. 5.4.3 shows the comparison ofquarkonia spectra obtained from BLFQ and CST. Inboth approaches, the model parameters were fixed byfittingtotheexperimentallymeasuredquarkoniamasses.
Then, the obtained wave functions were used to com-Fig. 5.4.14 Comparison of selected LFWFs of hb obtainedfrom BLFQ and CST [870]. The latter were converted fromthe BSA with the Brodsky-Huang-Lepage prescription [994].
The non-relativistic dominant spin components from both ap-proaches (top panels) are qualitatively the same. However, sub-dominant LFWFs may appear dramatically different, some ofwhich are in leading twist (bottom panels). This can be testedin high-energy exclusive processes. The discrepancy stems fromthe different implementation of the discrete symmetries on thelight cone in BLFQ and CST.

5.5 AdS/QCD and light-front holographyStanley J. Brodsky , Guy F. de Téramond,and Hans Güenter Dosch140 5 APPROXIMATE QCD5.5.1 IntroductionIn spite of the important progress of Euclidean latticeQCD [80] and other nonperturbative approaches, a ba-sic understanding of fundamental features of hadronphysics from first principles, such as the mechanism ofcolor confinement and the origin of the hadron massscale, as well as general features of hadron structure,spectroscopy and dynamics, have remained among themost important unsolved challenges of the last 50 yearsin particle physics. Furthermore, other essential prop-erties of the strong interactions, which were manifest indual models and developed before QCD, are also notexplicit properties of the QCD Lagrangian.
Recent theoretical developments for understandingfeatures of hadronic physics are based on AdS/CFT –thecorrespondencebetweenclassicalgravityinahigher-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space and conformalfield theories (CFT) in physical space-time [1000–1002].
AdS/CFT has provided a semiclassical approximationforstrongly-coupledquantumfieldtheories,givingphys-ical insights into nonperturbative dynamics. In prac-tice, the AdS/CFT duality provides an effective weaklycoupled description in a (d+ 1 )-dimensional AdSd+1space in terms of a flatd-dimensional superconformal,strongly coupled, quantum field theory defined on theAdSasymptoticboundary,thephysicalfour-dimensionalMinkowski spacetime, where boundary conditions areimposed [1003]. This is illustrated in Fig.5.5.1 for d=4, where the asymptotic surface of the 5-dimensionalAdS5 space is the physical four-dimensional Minkowskispacetime.
Anti-de Sitter AdSd+1 is the maximally symmetricd+ 1 space with negative constant curvature and ad-dimensional flat spacetime boundary. In Poincaré coor-dinates xM =(x0,x1,··· ,xd,z), where the asymptoticborder of AdS space is given byz= 0, the line elementisds2 = gMNdxMdxN= R2z2(ηµνdxµdxν −dz2), (5.5.1)where ηµν is the usual Minkowski metric ind dimen-sions, andR is the AdS radius. The group of transfor-mations leaving the AdSd+1 metric invariant, the isom-etry group SO(2,d), has dimension (d+ 1)( d+ 2) /2.
Five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space AdS5 has thus 15isometries,whichinduceintheMinkowski-spacebound-ary the symmetry under the conformal group with 15generators in four dimensions: 6 Lorentz transforma-tions plus 4 spacetime translations plus 4 special con-formal transformations plus 1 dilatation [1004]. Thisconformal symmetry implies that there can be no scaleFig. 5.5.1 Different values of the AdS radius z correspondto different scales at which the proton is examined. The innersphere (where AdS space terminates) is represented by the redsphere. The green “cone” represents the warping of AdS space(Its negative curvature characteristic of a hyperbolic space).
Therefore a proton “the small blue ball” appears as a smallerobject near the boundary of AdS as perceived by an observerin physical Minkowski space.
in the boundary theory and therefore no discrete spec-trum.
The relation between the dilatation symmetry andthe symmetries in AdS5 can be seen directly from theAdS metric since (5.5.1) is invariant under a dilatationof all coordinates: A dilatation of the Minkowski coordi-nates xµ →eσxµ is compensated by a dilatation of theholographic variablez→eσz. Therefore, the variablezacts like a scaling variable in Minkowski space: differ-ent values ofz correspond to different energy scales atwhich a measurement is made. As a result, short space-time intervals map to the boundary in AdS space-timenear z = 0 . This corresponds to the ultraviolet (UV)region of AdS space. On the other hand, a large four-dimensional object of confinement dimensions1/Λ2QCDmaps to the large IR region of AdS spacez∼1/ΛQCD.
Thus,in orderto incorporateconfinementinthe gravitydual the conformal invariance must be broken by modi-fying AdS space in the largezIR region. For example, asimple way to obtain confinement and discrete normal-izable modes (Fig.5.5.1) is to introduce a sharp cut-offat the IR borderz0 ∼1/ΛQCD, as in the “hard-wall’’model of Ref. [1005].
In general, one can deform the original AdS back-ground geometry, giving rise to a less symmetric gravitydual. This approach provides useful tools for construct-ing dual gravity models in higher dimensions which in-corporates confinement and basic QCD properties inphysical spacetime. The resulting gauge/gravity dualityis broadly known as the AdS/QCD correspondence, orsimply holographic QCD, which has become an exten-sivefieldofresearch.Theextenttowhichthefulltheory5.5 AdS/QCD and light-front holography 141of QCD can be described in such a framework remainsunclear. However, it is clear that holographic modelsmotivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence can cap-ture essential features of QCD and may give importantinsights into how QCD works. Different models can bederived via a top-down approach from brane configura-tions in string theory, as well as from more phenomeno-logical bottom-up models, which are not constrained bystring theory, and are therefore more flexible for incor-porating key aspects of QCD. The best known exam-ple of the first category is the Witten-Sakai-Sugimotomodel [1006], which contains vector mesons and pionsin its spectrum arising from the breaking of chiral sym-metry. Conversely, in the bottom-up hard-wall model ofRefs. [1007,1008], the globalSU(2)×SU(2) chiral sym-metry of QCD becomes a gauge invariant symmetry onthe gravity side. The AdS/QCD model of Refs. [1007,1008] has also been extended by using the “soft-wall’’model introduced in Ref. [1009] in order to reproducethe observed linearity of Regge trajectories.
A third approach to AdS/QCD,holographic light-front QCD (HLFQCD) [1010], is based on the holo-graphic embedding of Dirac’s relativisticfront form ofdynamics [909] into AdS space. In the front form, theinitial surface is the tangent plane to the light conex0 + x3= 0, the null plane, thus without reference toa specific Lorentz frame, in contrast with the usualin-stant form where quantization is defined at x0 = 0 .
This precise mapping between semiclassical LF Hamil-tonian equations in QCD and wave equations in AdSspace,[1011]leadstorelativisticwaveequationsinphys-ical space-time (similar to the Schrödinger or Diracwave equations in atomic physics) and provides an ef-fective computational framework of hadron structureand dynamics [1010] 37A remarkable property of HLFQCD is the embod-iment of a superconformal algebraic structure whichnot only introduces a mass scale within the algebra,but also determines the interaction completely [1017–1022].38 Further extensions of HLFQCD provides non-37 The origins of the light-front holographic approach canbe traced back to the original article of Polchinski andStrassler [1005], where the exclusive hard-scattering countingrules [134, 1012], a property of hadrons in physical spacetime,can be derived from the warped geometry of five-dimensionalAdS5 space. Indeed, one can show that a precise mapping be-tween the hadron form factors in AdS space [1013] and physicalspacetime [966, 967] can be carried out for an arbitrary numberof quark constituents [1014–1016]. The key holographic featureis the identification of the invariant transverse impact variableζ for then-parton bound state in physical 3+1 spacetime withthe holographic variablez, the fifth dimension of AdS.
38 The idea to apply an effective supersymmetry to hadronphysics is certainly not new [1023–1025], but failed to accountfor the special role of the pion. In contrast, in the HLFQCD ap-trivial interconnections between the dynamics of formfactors and quark and gluon distributions [1026–1028]withpre-QCDnonperturbativeapproachessuchasReggetheory and the Veneziano model.
In this section we give an overview of relevant as-pects of the holographic embedding of QCD quantizedin the light front, with an emphasis on the underly-ing superconformal structure for hadron spectroscopyand hadron duality for amplitude dynamics. Introduc-tory reviews are given in Refs. [1010, 1029–1031]. Otherreviews describing distinct approaches and aspects ofholographic QCD in the context of the gauge/grav-ity correspondence in addition to Refs. [1003, 1006],are given in Refs. [1032–1034] and in the book [1035],with applications to other topics such as holographicrenormalization group flows, QCD at finite tempera-ture and density, hydrodynamics and strongly coupledcondensed matter systems.
5.5.2 Semiclassical approximation to light-frontQCDA semiclassical approximation to QCD has been ob-tained using light-front (LF) physics, where the quanti-zation surface is the null plane,x+ = x0 +x3 = 0 [909].
Evolution in LF timex+ is given by the Hamiltonianequation [792]i ∂∂x+ |ψ⟩= P−|ψ⟩, P −|ψ⟩= P2⊥ + M2P+ |ψ⟩, (5.5.2)for a hadron with 4-momentum P = ( P+,P−,P⊥),P± = P0 ±P3, where P− is a dynamical generatorand P+ and P⊥ are kinematical. The simple structureof the LF vacuum allows a quantum-mechanical prob-abilistic interpretation of hadron states in terms of theeigenfunctions of the LF Hamiltonian equation (5.5.2)in a constituent particle basis,|ψ⟩= ∑nψn|n⟩, simi-lar to usual Schrödinger equation. The LF wave func-tions (LFWFs),ψn underly the physical properties ofhadrons in terms of their quark and gluon degrees offreedom. For aq¯q bound state we factor out the longi-tudinal X(x) and orbitaleiLθ dependence fromψ,ψ(x,ζ,θ ) = eiLθX(x) φ(ζ)√2πζ,where ζ2 = x(1 −x)b2⊥ is the invariant transverse sep-aration between two quarks, withb⊥, the relative im-pact variable, conjugate to the relative transverse mo-mentum k⊥ with longitudinal momentum fraction x.
proach, the zero-energy eigenmode of the superconformal quan-tum mechanical equations is identified with the lightest mesonwhich has no baryonic supersymmetric partner.142 5 APPROXIMATE QCDIn the ultra-relativistic zero-quark mass limit the in-variant LF HamiltonianPµPµ|ψ⟩= M2|ψ⟩, withP2 =P+P−−P2⊥ can be systematically reduced to the waveequation [1011]:(−d2dζ2 −1 −4L24ζ2 + U(ζ))φ(ζ) = M2φ(ζ), (5.5.3)where the effective potential U comprises all interac-tions, including those from higher Fock states. The crit-ical value of the LF orbital angular momentumL = 0corresponds to the lowest possible solution. The LFequation (5.5.3) is relativistic and frame-independent;It has a similar structure to wave equations in AdSprovided that one identifiesζ = z, the holographic vari-able [1011].
5.5.3 Higher integer-spin wave equations in AdSWe start with the AdS action for a tensor-J field ΦJ =ΦN1...NJ in the presence of a dilaton profileϕ(z) respon-sible for the confinement dynamicsS =∫d4xdz√geϕ(z) (DMΦJDMΦJ −µ2Φ2J), (5.5.4)where g is the determinant of the metric tensorgMNand DM is the covariant derivative which includes theaffine connection.3940 The variation of the AdS actionleads to the wave equation[−zd−1−2Jeϕ(z) ∂z( eϕ(z)zd−1−2J∂z)+ (µR)2z2]ΦJ(z)= M2ΦJ(z), (5.5.5)after a redefinition of the AdS massµ, plus kinematicalconstraints to eliminate lower spin from the symmetrictensor ΦN1...NJ [1036]. By substitutingΦJ(z) = z(d−1)/2−Je−ϕ(z)/2 φJ(z)in (5.5.5), we find the semiclassical light-front waveequation (5.5.3) withUJ(ζ) = 12ϕ′′(ζ) + 14ϕ′(ζ)2 + 2J−d+ 12ζ ϕ(ζ), (5.5.6)as long asζ = z. The precise mapping allows us to writethe LF confinement potentialU in terms of the dilatonprofile which modifies the IR region of AdS space to39 The affine connection, the vielbein and the spin connectionare important elements in curved spaces, particularly if higherspins are involved. A brief introduction, useful for actual com-putations in AdS space, is given in Appendix A of Ref. [1010].

incorporate confinement [1010], while keeping the the-ory conformal invariant in the ultraviolet boundary ofAdS, namely ϕ(z) →0 for z →0. The separation ofkinematic and dynamic components, allows us to de-termine the mass function in the AdS action in termsof physical kinematic quantities with the AdS mass-radius (µR)2 = L2 −(d/2 −J)2 and d, the number oftransverse coordinates [1011, 1036], consistent with theAdS stability bound [1037].
5.5.4 Higher half-integer-spin wave equations inAdSA similar derivation follows from the Rarita-Schwingeraction for a spinor fieldΨJ ≡ΨN1...NJ−1/2 in AdS [1036]for half-integral spinJ. In this case, however, the dila-ton term does not lead to an interaction [1038], and aneffective Yukawa-type coupling to a potentialV in theaction has to be introduced instead [1039–1041]:S =∫d4xdz√g ¯ΨJ(iΓAeMA DM −µ+ zRV(z))ΨJ,(5.5.7)where eMA is the vielbein and the covariant derivativeDM on a spinor field includes the affine connection andthe spin connection. The tangent space Dirac matricesobey the usual anticommutation relations{ΓA,ΓB}=2ηAB. The variation of the AdS action leads to a systemof linear differential equations which is equivalent to thesecond order equations [1036](−d2dζ2 −1 −4L24ζ2 + U+(ζ))ψ+ = M2ψ+,(5.5.8)(−d2dζ2 −1 −4(L+ 1)24ζ2 + U−(ζ))ψ− = M2ψ−,(5.5.9)with ζ = z, |µR| = L + 1 /2 and equal probability∫dζψ2+(ζ)2 =∫dζψ2−(ζ). The semiclassical LF waveequations forψ+ and ψ− correspond to LF orbital an-gular momentumL and L+ 1 withU±(ζ) = V2(ζ) ±V′(ζ) + 1 + 2 Lζ V(ζ), (5.5.10)a J-independent potential, in agreement with the ob-served degeneracy in the baryon spectrum.
5.5.5 Superconformal algebraic structure and emer-gence of a mass scaleEmbedding light-front physics in a higher dimensiongravity theory leads to important insights into the non-perturbativestructureofboundstateequationsinQCD5.5 AdS/QCD and light-front holography 143forarbitraryspin,butitdoesnotanswerthequestionofhow the effective confinement dynamics is actually de-termined, and how it can be related to the symmetriesof QCD itself. An important clue, however, comes fromthe realization that the potentialV(ζ) in Eq. (5.5.10)plays the role of the superpotential in supersymmetric(SUSY) quantum mechanics (QM) [1042].
Supersymmetric QM is based on a graded Lie al-gebra consisting of two anticommuting superchargesQand Q†, {Q,Q}= {Q†,Q†}= 0 , which commute withthe HamiltonianH = 12 {Q,Q†}, [Q,H] = [ Q†,H] = 0 .
If the state|E⟩is an eigenstate with energyE, H|E⟩=E|E⟩, then, it follows from the commutation relationsthat the stateQ†|E⟩is degenerate with the state|E⟩forE ̸= 0 , but forE = 0 we haveQ†|E = 0 ⟩= 0 , namelythe zero mode has no supersymmetric partner [1042]; akey result for deriving the supermultiplet structure andthe pattern of the hadron spectrum.
FollowingRef.[ 1018]weconsiderthescale-deformedsupercharge operatorRλ = Q+λS, withK = 12 {S,S†}the generator of special conformal transformations. Thegenerator Rλ is also nilpotent,{Rλ,Rλ}= {R†λ,R†λ}=0, and gives rise to a new scale-dependent HamiltonianG, G= 12 {Rλ,R†λ}, which also closes under the gradedalgebra, [Rλ,G] = [ R†λ,G] = 0 . The new superchargeRλ has the matrix representationRλ =(0 rλ0 0), R †λ =(0 0r†λ 0), (5.5.11)with rλ = −∂x + fx + λx, r†λ = ∂x + fx + λx. Theparameter f is dimensionless andλ has the dimensionof [M2], and thus, a mass scale is introduced in theHamiltonian without leaving the conformal group. TheHamiltonian equationG|E⟩= E|E⟩leads to the waveequations[− d2dx2 −1 −4(f + 12 )24x2 + λ2 x2 + 2λ(f −12)]φ+= Eφ+, (5.5.12)[− d2dx2 −1 −4(f −12 )24x2 + λ2 x2 + 2λ(f + 12)]φ−= Eφ−, (5.5.13)which have the same structure as the Euler-Lagrangeequations obtained from the AdS/CFT correspondence,but here, the form of the LF confinement potential,λ2x2, as well as the constant terms in the potential arecompletelyfixedbythesuperconformalsymmetry[ 1021,1022].

substitutions x ↦→ζ, E ↦→M2, f ↦→L+ 12 , φ+ ↦→ψ− and φ− ↦→ψ+, we find the expressionU+ = λ2ζ2 +2λ(L+ 1) and U− = λ2ζ2 + 2λL for the confine-ment potential for baryons [1021].

The polynomi-als LLn(x) are associated Laguerre polynomials, wherethe radial quantum number n counts the number ofnodes in the wave function. We compare in Fig.5.5.2the model predictions with the measured values for thepositive parity nucleons [476] for√λ= 0.485 GeV.144 5 APPROXIMATE QCD5.5.7 Superconformal meson-baryon symmetrySuperconformal quantum mechanics also leads to a con-nection between mesons and baryons [1022] underlyingthe SU(3)C representation properties, since a diquarkcluster can be in the same color representation as anantiquark, namely¯3 ∈3×3. The specific connection fol-lows from the substitutionx↦→ζ, E↦→M2, λ↦→λB =λM, f↦→LM −12 = LB + 12 , φ+ ↦→φM and φ2 ↦→φBin the superconformal equations (5.5.12) and (5.5.13).
We find the LF meson (M) – baryon (B) bound-stateequations(−d2dζ2 −1 −4L2M4ζ2 + UM)φM = M2 φM, (5.5.16)(−d2dζ2 −1 −4L2B4ζ2 + UB)φB = M2 φB, (5.5.17)withtheconfinementpotentials UM = λ2M ζ2+2λM(LM−1) and UB = λ2Bζ2 + 2λB(LB + 1).
Thesuperconformalstructureimposestheconditionλ= λM = λB and the remarkable relationLM = LB+1, whereLM is the LF angular momentum between thequark and antiquark in the meson, and LB betweenthe active quark and spectator cluster in the baryon.
Likewise, the equality of the Regge slopes embodies theequivalence of the3C −¯3C color interaction in theq¯qmeson with the3C −¯3C interaction between the quarkand diquark cluster in the baryon. The mass spectrumfrom (5.5.16) and (5.5.17) isM2M = 4λ(n+ LM) and M2B = 4λ(n+ LB + 1).
(5.5.18)The pion has a special role as the unique state of zeromass and, since LM = 0 , it does not have a baryonpartner.
AdS space is effectively modified in the IR by thedilaton profile in Eq. (5.5.5), while retaining confor-mal invariance in the UV (near the boundary of AdSspace): It leads to the effective confinement potentialU(z) in Eq. (5.5.6). The dilaton profile can be deter-mined from the superconformal algebra by integratingEq. (5.5.6) for the effective potential U in (5.5.16),U(z) = λ2z2 + 2 λ(L −1). We obtain ϕ(z) = λz2.
The dilaton is uniquely determined, provided that itdepends only on the modification of AdS space [1043].
5.5.8 Spin interaction and diquark clustersEmbedding the LF bound-state equations in AdS spaceallows us to extend the superconformal Hamiltonian toinclude the spin-spin interaction, a problem not definedin the chiral limit by standard procedures.

The effect of the spin term is an overall shift of thequadratic mass,M2M = 4λ(n+ LM) + 2 λS, (5.5.19)M2B = 4λ(n+ LB + 1) + 2 λS, (5.5.20)as depicted in Fig.5.5.3 for the spectra of theρmesonsand∆baryonsbyshiftingoneunitthevalueof LB [1022].
This shift leads to a degeneracy of meson and baryonsstates, a property known as the MacDowell symme-try [1045, 1046].
For the ∆ baryons the total internal spinS is re-lated to the diquark cluster spinSby S = S+ 12 (−1)L,and therefore, positive and negative ∆ baryons havethe same diquark spin,S= 1 . As a result, all the∆baryons lie, for a givenn, on the same Regge trajec-tory, as shown in Fig.5.5.2. Plus parity nucleons areassigned S = 0 and are well described by the holo-graphic model as shown in Fig.5.5.2. For negative par-ity nucleons bothS= 0 and S= 1 are possible, buttheir precise comparison with data is not as successfulas for the∆ baryons and positive parity nucleons.
5.5.9 Inclusion of quark masses and longitudinaldynamicsFinite quark masses break conformal invariance andpose a special challenge for all AdS/CFT approaches5.5 AdS/QCD and light-front holography 145 Fig. 5.5.4 The K∗ and Σ∗ trajectories from supersymmetricHLFQCD in Ref.

since the dual quantum field theory is inherently con-formal. In the usual formulation of bottom-up holo-graphic models one identifies quark mass and chiralcondensates as coefficients of a scalar background fieldX0(z) in AdS space [1007, 1008]. A heuristic way totake into account the occurrence of quark mass terms,is to include the quark mass dependence in the invari-ant mass (IM) squared which controls the off-shell de-pendence of the LF wave function [1010, 1047]: χIM =Nexp(−12λ∑im2ixi), whereNis a normalization factor.
This simple procedure leads, to a factorization of thetransverse, φ(ζ), and the longitudinal,χ(x), wave func-tions with the quadratic mass correction [1010, 1044,1047] ∆M2 = ⟨χ|∑im2ixi|χ⟩.
The effective quark masses can be obtained by com-paring the holographic results with the observed pseu-doscalar masses. One obtainsmq = 0 .046 GeV for thelight quark mass andms = 0 .350 GeV for the strangemass, with values between the Lagrangian and the con-stituent masses [1010, 1044, 1047]. The analysis hasbeen consistently applied to the radial and orbital ex-citation spectra of the light meson and baryon fami-lies, giving the value√λ = 0 .523 ±0.024 GeV [1044].
The comparison of the predicted K∗ and Σ∗ trajec-tories with experiment shown in Fig.5.5.4 is a clearexample of the validity of the supersymmetric meson-baryon connection including light quark masses. Start-ing with Ref. [1049], the application of the light-frontholographic wave functions to diffraction physics hasalso been successful.

Compatibility with heavy quark symmetry [1043, 1048,1050–1054] predicts a dependence of the holographicmass scaleλ on the quark mass.41The extension of the LF holographic framework toincorporate longitudinal dynamics and chiral symmetrybreaking,inspiredintheoriginalworkof’tHooft[ 1057],has recently attracted much interest [950, 989, 1055,1058–1068]; however, in contrast with the transversedynamics, the longitudinal confinement potential is notuniquely determined by the symmetries of the model.
5.5.10 Completing the supersymmetric hadronmultipletBesides the mesons and the baryons, the supersym-metric multipletΦ= {φM,φ+B,φ−B,φT}contains a fur-ther bosonic partner, a tetraquark, which, follows fromthe action of the SUSY operatorR†λ on the negative-chirality component of a baryon [1044]. A clear exampleis the SUSY positive parityJP multiplet 2+,32+,1+ ofstates f2(1270), ∆(1232), a1(1260) where thea1 is in-terpreted as a tetraquark.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to disentangle conven-tionalhadronicquarkstatesfromexoticonesand,there-fore, no clear-cut identification of tetraquarks for lighthadrons, or hadrons with hidden charm or beauty, ispossible [1044, 1053, 1069]. The situation is, however,more favorable for tetraquarks with open charm andbeauty which may be stable under strong interactionsand therefore easily identified [1070]. In Table5.5.1, thecomputed masses from Ref. [1054] are presented. Ourprediction [1054] for a doubly charmed stable bosonTcc with a mass of 3870 MeV (second row) has beenobserved at LHCb a year later at 3875 MeV [1071],and it is a member of the positive parityJP multiplet2+,32+,1+ of states χc2(3565), Ξcc(3770), Tcc(3875).
The occurrence of stable doubly beautiful tetraquarksand those with charm and beauty is well established,see also Ref. [1070].

[ 1055,1056].146 5 APPROXIMATE QCD5.5.11 Holographic QCD and V eneziano Ampli-tudesThe hadronic mass spectrum (5.5.18), which followsfromthescaledeformedsuperconformalequations( 5.5.12)and (5.5.13), shows remarkable features which were es-sential ingredients to the pre-QCD physics of strong in-teractions.Startingfromthe S-matrix,ChewandFrautschi[1072] proposed to extend the concept of Regge trajec-tories [1073], α(t) = α0 + α′t, also to positivet-values.
It led to a quadratic mass spectra, linear in the an-gular momentum, just as the spectra of Eq. (5.5.18).
The analogy goes further: Veneziano [7] constructed ahadronic scattering amplitudeA(s,t) ∼B(1 −α(s),1 −α(t)), (5.5.21)basedonEuler’sBetafunction B(u,v) = Γ(u)Γ(v)Γ(u+v) ,whichincorporates the duality in strong interactions [1074]and linear Regge trajectories. It is easy to see thatthis amplitude leads to particle poles at masses ex-actly matching Eq. (5.5.18), if one identifies the slopeof the trajectory with the scale λ: α′ = 14λ. In fact,from the analytic structure of the Beta function, par-ticle poles appear at each value whereα(t) is a neg-ative integer. This leads to “Regge-daughter trajecto-ries”, which are identified with the radial excitationsnumbered by the integer n in (5.5.18). But there isan important difference in the theoretical foundation:in the Veneziano approach, linear trajectories were as-sumed to exist, whereas here they are a consequenceof the model, especially of the superconformal model,where the Regge interceptα0 is also determined, andexpressed in terms of quark masses.
5.5.12 Electromagnetic form factors in holographicQCDHolographic QCD incorporates important elements forthe study of hadronic form factors, such as the connec-tion between the twist of the hadron to the fall-off of itscurrent matrix elements for largeQ2, and important as-pects of vector meson dominance which are relevant atlower energies. The expression for the electromagnetic(EM) form factor (FF) in AdS space has been given byPolchinski and Strassler [1013]F(Q2) =∫ dzz3 V(Q2,z) Φ2(z), (5.5.22)in their influential article describing deep inelastic scat-tering(DIS)usingthegauge/gravitycorrespondence 42.
42 For recent DIS studies examining various holographic QCDmodels see Ref [1075] and references therein.
It is written as the overlap of a normalizable modeΦ(z), representing a bound-state wave function in AdSfor the initial and final states, with a non-normalizablesolution V(Q2,z) of the wave equation (5.5.5) for a spinone conserved current in AdS, withµ = 0 and M2 →−Q2. The bulk-to boundary propagator,V(Q2,z) car-ries momentum Q2 = −t >0 from the external EMcurrent. A precise mapping can be carried out to phys-ical spacetime provided that the invariant transverseimpact variableζ for an arbitrary number of quarks isidentified with the holographic variablez [1014].
Forthesoft-wallmodel(SWM)ofRef.[ 1009]Φτ(z) ∼zτe−λz2/2, andV(Q2,z) is given in terms of the Tricomifunction, V(Q2,z) ∼U(Q2/4λ,0,λz2). It correspondstoaconservedvectorcurrentwithvanishingmass µ= 0in AdS. The result for the FF [1010] can be brought intothe form of an Euler Beta functionFSWMτ (t) ∼B(τ −1,1 −t/4λ). (5.5.23)It generates a series of poles located atM2n = 4λ(n+1),and thus to the Regge interceptα0 = 0 [1076]. There-fore, one has to perform a pole shift [1010, 1026, 1027,1077] in the expression (5.5.23) in order to bring the an-alyticalstructureoftheFFinaccordancewiththespec-tra predicted by HLFQCD, which is in perfect agree-ment with observations. This shift leads to [1026]FHLFτ (t) ∼B(τ −1, 1/2 −t/4λ), (5.5.24)for the EM form factors in HLFQCD.
5.5.13 F orm factors in dual models and holo-graphic QCDIn a model extending the duality concept incorporatedin Eq. (5.5.21) to reactions involving external currents,Ademollo and Del Giudice [1078], and Landshoff andPolkinghorne [1079], proposed a a Veneziano-like am-plitudeFγ(t) ∼B(γ,1 −αρ(t)), (5.5.25)in order to describe the electromagnetic FF; hereαρ(t)is the Regge trajectory of theρ meson which couplesto the quark current in the hadron, and the parame-ter γ controls the rate of decrease of the FF. In fact,from Stirling’s formula we find the asymptotic behaviorFγ(Q2) ∼(1Q2)γfor largeQ2 = −t.
In LF QCD the parameterγhas a well defined inter-pretation. To see this, we compare the asymptotic ex-pressionfor Fγ(Q2) withthe result from hard scatteringcounting rules at largeQ2 [134], Fτ(Q2) ∼(1Q2)τ−1,where the twistτ is the number of constituentsN in a5.5 AdS/QCD and light-front holography 147given Fock component of the hadron. Thus, one has tochoose in Eq. (5.5.25) γ = τ−1, in order to incorporatethe scaling counting rule. This brings us to our final re-sult for the analytical expression of the electromagneticFF in the extended duality model [1026]Fτ(t) = 1NτB(τ −1,1 −α(t)) , (5.5.26)with Nτ = B(τ−1,1 −α(0)), a remarkable expressionwhich incorporates, at tree level, both the nonpertur-bative pole structure of the form factor and the hardscattering behavior.
For τ = N, the number of constituents, the FF(5.5.26) is anN −1 product of poles located at [1010]−Q2 = t= M2n = 1α′(n+ 1 −α(0))>0 .
It generates the radial excitation spectrum of the ex-changed vector mesons in thet-channel. For example,the ρtrajectory has Regge interceptα0 = 1/2 and slopeα≡1/4λ, withλ≃(0.5 GeV) 2. ThusM2n = 4λ(n+ 12 ),corresponding to theρ vector meson and its radial ex-citations for n = 0 ,1,2,...,τ −2 in agreement withEq. (5.5.19). In general, the hadron wave function isa superposition of an infinite number of Fock compo-nents, and thus the full form factor should be writ-ten as a superposition F(Q2) = ∑τ CτFτ(Q2), with∑τ Cτ = 1, if all possible states are included. In prac-tice, one expects a rapid convergence in the number ofpoles, with a dominant contribution from theρ vectormeson plus contributions from the higher resonancesρ′,ρ′′, …, etc.
As a simple example, consider the valence contri-bution to the nucleon EM (spin non-flip) Dirac formfactors by writing the flavor FFs asFu(t) =(2 −r3)F3(t) + r3F4(t), (5.5.27)Fd(t) =(1 −2r3)F3(t) + 2r3 F4(t), (5.5.28)whereFτ(Q2) is given by (5.5.26). The holographic con-straint of equal probability for nucleon states with LForbital angular momentum L and L+ 1 (Sec. 5.5.4)determines the value r = 3 /2, since the probabilityof the total quark spin along the plusz-direction forL= 0 (twist 3) should be identical to the probability ofhaving total quark spin along the minusz-direction forL= 1. Actually, the values found in the recent analysisin Ref. [1027] deviate by 10 ∼15 % for the u-flavorFF and remain almost identical for thed quark in thevalence approximation. This leads to the results showin Fig. 5.5.5 for the nucleon isospin FF combination,FI=0,1 = Fp(t) ±Fn(t), where we compare the model�������� ���� ���� � � ������������������������������������� � (�� )ρ(770)a2(1320)ρ3(1690)a4(2040)0 1 2 3 4 5012345tGeV 2α(t)Fig. 5.5.5 The LFHQCD prediction for theI = 0 ,1 isospincombinations of nucleon factors compared with thez-expansiondata analysis of Ye et al.

5.5.14 Quark distribution functions and the exclusive-inclusive connectionThe mathematical structure of the Veneziano-type FFs(5.5.26), not only incorporates the hard scattering am-plitude’s dependence on twist, but it also gives impor-tant insights into the structure of the parton distribu-tions since it becomes possible to include the Reggebehavior at small values ofx, as well as the exclusive-inclusive connection [966, 1082] at large values of thelongitudinal momentum x [1026]. In fact, the relationbetween the behavior of the structure function nearx = 1 with the falloff of the FF at larget, describedin the article of Landshoff and Polkinghorne [1079], isvery close to the Drell-Yan “exclusive-inclusive” con-nection, also formulated in 1970 [966].

(5.5.29)The trajectory α(t) of the vector current can be com-putedwithinthesuperconformalLFholographicframe-work, and the intercept,α(0), incorporates the quarkmasses [1021, 1022]. The functionw(x) is a flavor-inde-pendent function withw(0) = 0 , w(1) = 1 and w′(x) ≥0.148 5 APPROXIMATE QCDThe flavor FF can be written in terms of its general-ized parton distribution (GPD) [1083–1085], Hq(x,t) ≡Hq(x,ξ = 0,t), at zero skewness,ξ,Fq(t) =∫ 10dxHq(x,t)=∫ 10dxq(x) exp [tf(x)] , (5.5.30)with the profile function, f(x), and the particle dis-tribution function (PDF), qτ(x), both determined byw(x):f(x) = 14λlog( 1w(x)), (5.5.31)qτ(x) = 1Nτw′(x)w(x)−α(0)[1 −w(x)]τ−2, (5.5.32)with α = 1 /4λ. Boundary conditions follow from theRegge behavior at x →0, w(x) ∼x, and at x →1from the exclusive-inclusive counting rule [966, 1082],qτ(x) ∼(1 −x)2τ−3, which fixesw′(1) = 0 . A simpleansatz forw(x), w(x) = x1−x exp(−a(1 −x)2), fulfillsall conditions mentioned above. The flavor independentparameter a has the valuea≃0.5 [1026].
Usingtheexpression( 5.5.30)at t= 0 andEqs.( 5.5.27-5.5.28),we obtain for the unpolarized quark distributions in thevalence approximationuv(x) =(2 −r3)q3(x) + r3q4(x), (5.5.33)dv(x) =(1 −2r3)q3(x) + 2r3 q4(x), (5.5.34)with normalization∫dxuv(x) = 2 and∫dxdv(x) = 1 .
The PDFqτ(x) is given by (5.5.32) andr = 3 /2. OurPDF results for the nucleon, Eqs. (5.5.33-5.5.34), andfor the pion [1026], are compared with the global dataanalysis in Fig.5.5.6. If the reparametrization functionw(x) is fixed by the nucleon PDFs, then the pion PDFis a prediction. pQCD evolution is performed from aninitial scale determined fromµ0 ≃1 GeV from the soft-hard matching procedure described in Ref. [1091]. Ourresult for the pion PDF in Fig.5.5.6 is in good agree-ment with the data analysis in Ref. [1088] and con-sistent with the nucleon global fit through the GPDuniversality introduced in [1026]. It leads to a 1 −xfalloff, in contrast with the(1 −x)2 pQCD result atlarge-x[1089,1092],anissuemuchdebatedrecently[ 845,1093, 1094].

The normaliza-tion of the charm form factor was computed using lat-tice QCD [1095], and theJ/Ψ trajectory in the GPDsfrom HLFQCD and heavy quark effective theory [1053].
A similar procedure was used to determine the intrinsicstrange-antistrange asymmetry in the proton with theRegge trajectory in the holographic expressions corre-sponding to theφ meson current [1081], and most re-cently to study color transparency in nuclei [1096] (seeSec. 5.10), and to model the EMC effect in various nu-clei [1097].
5.5.15 Gravitational form factors, gluon distri-butions and the Pomeron trajectoryGravitational form factors (GFFs) are the hadronic ma-trix elements of the energy momentum tensor (EMT)and describe the coupling of a hadron to the gravi-ton, thus providing key information on the dynamicsof quarks and gluons within hadrons. In holographicQCD Pomeron exchange is identified as the graviton ofthe dual AdS theory [1098–1103]. The Pomeron couplesas a rank-two tensor to hadrons and interacts stronglywith gluons. Since we are interested in obtaining the in-trinsic gluon distribution in the nucleon, we use the softPomeron of Donnachie and Landshoff [1104] with theRegge trajectory αP(t) = αP(0) + α′Pt, with interceptαP(0) ≃1.08 and slopeαP ≃0.25 GeV−2 [476].
To actually compute the GFF one considers the per-turbation of the gravity action by an arbitrary externalsource at the AdS asymptotic boundary which propa-gates inside AdS space and couples to the EMT [1016,1105]. In analogy to the EM FF (5.5.22), the spin non-flip GFFA(t) is written as the overlap of a normalizablemode Φ(z), representing a bound-state wave, with anon-normalizablemode H(Q2,z),thebulk-to-boundarypropagator, corresponding to the gravitational currentin AdS. We obtain [1016, 1105]A(t) =∫ dzz3 H(Q2,z) Φ2(z). (5.5.35)For the soft-wall profile introduced in Ref. [1009],the propagator in AdS,H(Q2,z), is also given by a Tri-comifunction[ 1010,1105],H(Q2,z) ∼U(Q2/4λg,−1,λgz2).

As for the EM FF, inwriting (5.5.36) we have also shifted the Pomeron in-tercept to its physical valueαP(0) ≈1, since the holo-graphic result (5.5.35) leads to a zero intercept. For in-teger twist, the GFF (5.5.36) is expressed as a productof τ −1 timelike poles located at−Q2 = M2n = 1α′P(n+ 2 −αP(0)) , (5.5.37)theradialexcitationspectrumofthespin-twoPomeron.
The lowest state in this trajectory, the2++, has themass M ≃ 1.92 GeV, compared with the lattice re-sults M ≃(2.15 −2.4) GeV [476] 43. We notice thatEq. (5.5.36) is the Veneziano amplitude of the FF for aspin-two current [1078, 1079].
The lowest twist contributions to the GFF corre-sponds to theτ = 4 Fock state|uudg⟩in the proton andthe τ = 3 component |u¯dg⟩in the pion, both containingan intrinsic gluon. The results forAg(t) are comparedin Fig.5.5.8 with recent lattice computations. We findfor the gluon mass squared radius⟨r2g⟩p = 2 .93/λg =(0.34 fm)2 fortheprotonand ⟨r2g⟩π = 2.41/λg = (0.31 fm)2for the pion. The model predictions in Fig.5.5.8 haveno free parameters [1028].
43 There exist many computations of glueballs in top-downholographic models, see for example, [1106]; and also in bottom-up models. For a recent computation, see for example [1107],and references therein.150 5 APPROXIMATE QCDThe intrinsic gluon distributions in the proton andthe pion can be determined from the gravitational formfactor (5.5.36) following the same procedure used inSec. 5.5.14. The results are given in [1028] and agreevery well with the data analysis from [626, 627, 979,1110, 1111]. The model uncertainties for largex-valuesare smaller than those from the phenomenological anal-ysis.
By using the gauge/gravity a simultaneous descrip-tion of the BFKL hard Pomeron [140, 218, 1112] andthe soft Regge domain has been proposed in Ref. [1098].
This model, however, did not solve the problem of thelargedifferenceofinterceptvaluesbetweenbothPomerons.
Using the scale dependence of the gluon distributionfunctions, our results give strong support to a singlePomeron with a scale dependent intercept [1113], whichwas proposed in Ref. [1114] in order to explain thediffractive scattering data at LHC energies [1115, 1116].
5.5.16 SummaryHolographic light front QCD is a nonperturbative an-alytic approach to hadron physics. It originates fromthe precise mapping of light front expressions of formfactors in AdS space for an arbitrary number of par-tons [1014]. The holographic embedding in AdS alsoleads to semiclassical relativistic wave equations, simi-lar to the Schrödinger equation in atomic physics, forarbitrary integer or half-integer spin [1011, 1036].

There is a zero eigenmode which is identified with thepion: It is massless in the chiral limit. The new frame-work leads to relations between the Regge trajectoriesof mesons, baryons, and tetraquarks. It also incorpo-rates features of pre QCD, such as Veneziano modeland Regge theory. Further extensions incorporate theexclusive-inclusiveconnectioninQCDandprovidenon-trivial relations between hadron form factors and quarkand gluon distributions. Measurements of the strongcoupling in the nonperturbative domain [1117] are re-markably consistent with the predicted form in holo-graphic QCD [158], a relevant issue in QCD which isdiscussedinthenextsection 5.6.HolographiclightfrontQCD has led to significant advances in understand-inghadronphenomenabyincorporatingemergingQCDproperties in an effective computational framework ofhadron structure.
5.6 The nonperturbative strong couplingAlexandre DeurThe perturbative framework of QCD (pQCD) has beenremarkably successful in describing the interactions be-tween the fundamental constituents of hadrons in highenergy experiments, thus establishing QCD as the the-ory of the strong force at small distances [278]. Mostof nature’s strong force phenomena, however, are gov-erned by large-distance, nonperturbative physics [748,1118–1122] where the methods of pQCD are not appli-cable. The Landau pole at low-energies in the runningof the QCD coupling is an example of the expected fail-ure of perturbation theory as the coupling increases. Anonperturbative treatment is necessary and allows usto define renormalization scheme dependent couplingconstants.
Studying αs(µ) at low energy has been challenging:not only do nonperturbative calculations represent adifficult problem to solve, but more generally, we onlyknow in the pQCD framework how to relate the αscalculated in different schemes. Worst, there is no ob-vious prescription of how to define the coupling. Onereason why a variety of definitions is possible is thatαs(µ) need not be an observable. In fact, in most ap-proaches –including the standard pQCD treatment– itis not an observable. For exampleαpQCDs depends onthe choice of renormalization scheme, generally takento beMS. Such arbitrary dependence on a human con-vention shows thatαs(µ) is not an observable. In addi-tion, the quark-gluon, 3-gluon, 4-gluon or ghost-gluonvertices may have different couplings 44 i.e., severalcouplings, with distinct magnitudes andµ-dependence,may be necessary to characterize QCD. This happensbecausetheSlavnov-TaylorIdentities(STI)[ 1123,1124],the QCD equivalent of QED’s Ward-Takahashi rela-tion [1125, 1126], may not hold under certain choices ofgauges and renormalization schemes, such as the MOMscheme. With the oft-usedMS scheme, the STI hold,viz,αqg,MSs = α3g,MSs = α4g,MSs = αgh,MSsbut MS is not practical for nonperturbative methodssuch as Lattice QCD and in the nonperturbative do-main, the difference betweenαqg,MOMs ,α3g,MOMs ,α4g,MOMs ,αgh,MOMs44 When needed, we will use superscripts to qualify the cou-pling. For examples, αpQCD,MSs is the perturbative couplingin the MS scheme, or αqg,MOMs , α3g,MOMs , α4g,MOMs andαgh,MOMs are the couplings for the quark-gluon, 3-gluon, 4-gluon or ghost-gluon vertices, respectively, computed in theMOM scheme.5.6 The nonperturbative strong coupling 151is conspicuous. A wholly different approach is to defineαs(µ) to be an observable [146], in analogy with theobservable QED couplingα [1127], but while this cir-cumvents the issues of breaking the STI and of schemeand gauge dependence, the prescription is rarely usedin pQCD.
Many definitions ofαs have been considered, result-ing in a range of values ofαs(µ ≪Λs) from 0 to∞,generating much confusion. Adding to this is the factthat, unlike the high-energy domain where pQCD rules,there is no obviously superior method to study the non-perturbative behavior ofαs(µ). This is, of course, dueto the challenge of solving QCD nonperturbatively. Allmajor non-perturbative approaches, See Secs.4,5.3,5.5have been used (with the conspicuous exception of chi-ral effective field theory, Sec.6.2, since its hadronic de-grees of freedom do not couple withαs) as well as manymodels. These methods using different type of approx-imations, and the models being not directly based onQCD’s Lagrangian or its symmetries, results have oftendiffered. Yet a number of studies have converged towarda fruitful definition ofαs(µ) which allows us to accountfor low energy phenomenology [1128]. Before describingit, we will first recall in broad brushstrokes the historyof this endeavor, referring only to pioneering attemptsand not the important body of subsequent works thatclarified and refined these attempts.
Soon after the advent of QCD, it was realized thatαs(µ) may display a plateau whenµ →0 (it is saidto freeze at low µ) [ 1129–1131], viz, the β functionof QCD, Eq. (1.2.6) may obey β(µ → 0) → 0. Theactual freezing value αs(0) was debated and rangedfrom typically 0.5 to 5 [1128]. A pioneering and influ-ential work in this context is due to Cornwall [1132]who used the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE), thegluon self-energy and initiated a method (the Pinchtechnique,PT)thatallowstoobtaingauge-independentresults. The ensuing couplingαgse,PTs displays a freezingbehavior in qualitative agreement with quark models(e.g., Ref. [735] and Sec.5.1) and quarkonium spectrummodels (e.g., Ref. [82]).
A freezing ofαs(µ) was by no mean the only pro-posal: others reasoned that it should diverge as1/µ2[1133], that it should monotonically increase with1/µ,but without diverging [1134], or that it should vanishas µ →0 [153, 1135]. In all these case,β(µ →0) ̸= 0 .
As we alluded to, multiple reasons caused these widelyvarying expectations [1128]: differences in the basic def-initionof αs(µ);choiceofvertexusedtocomputeit;cal-culation artifacts from approximations (e.g., discretiza-tion in lattice QCD or truncation prescription for theDSE and other functional methods); choice of gaugeand renormalization scheme;45 or the existence of mul-tiple solutions to the QCD equations providingαs(µ)without a decisive argument on which one is realized innature. A prominent example is thedecoupling [1135]and the scaling [1138] solutions that yield a vanishingor a freezing αgh,MOMs , respectively. Functional meth-ods and lattice QCD have produced both solutions, al-beit well-controlled lattice calculations appear to yieldonly the decoupling solution. In these calculationsαghs ,called theTaylor coupling [1123], is most often used be-cause it is the simplest coupling that can be computedfrom QCD correlation functions.
It is generally believed, after much discussion, thatthe decoupling solution is the one realized in nature,which simply means that in the particular gauges whereghost fields appear, the gluon and ghost fields decou-ple at lowµ. This is an important finding regarding thebehavior of gluons and ghosts but it does not directly il-luminate the strength of the strong force at low energy.
Besides using correlation functions, other prevalent ap-proaches to defineαs(µ) are effective charges [146] andanalytic approaches [160,1134] –both methods promoteαs(µ) to an observable quantity– or direct use of phe-nomenology, for example, using constituent quark mod-els, the Q–Q potential or the hadronic spectrum [82,735, 1133, 1139–1142]. Like the DSE that must choosea truncation prescription, and lattice QCD with finitesize lattices, discretization or pion mass approxima-tions,theothermethodsalsouseapproximationsor/andinclude model-dependencies whose effects are often notwell controlled. The synergy arising from methods withvery distinct approximations allowed for a better un-derstanding of the latter.
After many studies and developments, of which theaforesaid narrative is too a laconic cartoon, a couplingwas identified and computed using a formalism guar-antying that the STI hold in the nonperturbative do-main [1143]. Therefore, QCD is here characterized by asingle coupling, independent of the choice of vertex orprocess used to define it (process-independent, PI). Inaddition, the Pinch technique [1132] is used to guarantygauge-independence. The calculation, using either theDSE or lattice QCD results on correlation functions,yields a couplingαPI,Pinchs in agreement with the phe-nomenological coupling [1117, 1145, 1146] derived fromthe Bjorken sum rule [23] using the effective charge(EC) method [146], αEC,g1s , and with αAdS/QCDs ob-tained using AdS/QCD [158, 1091], See Sec.5.5.
The latter is derived starting from the observationthat for strongly coupled systems with a gravity dual,45 This issue has become negligible with the developmentsof methods removing renormalization scale ambiguities [1136,1137].152 5 APPROXIMATE QCD00.511.522.5310-11µ (GeV)αs(µ)αsEC,g1 (Bjorken sum rule)αsAdS/QCDαsPI,PinchαsEC,g1, CERN, DESY,JLab, SLACαsEC,g1 (GDH limit)Fig. 5.6.1 Nonperturbative strong couplings calculated withthe holographic QCD framework (αAdS/QCDs , red line) [158],and Dyson-Schwinger formalism using the lattice determina-tionsofcorrelationsfunctions( αPI,Pinchs ,magentaband)[ 1143,1144].

the radial direction in the bulk can be associated withthe energy scale of the boundary theory [1149]: Largevalues of µ correspond to small values of z near thehigh-momentum conformal boundary of AdS,µ∼1/z.
Conversely, large-z distances in the low-momentum re-gion of AdS correspond to low energy scales in the phys-ical theory. The dilaton factorexp(ϕ(z)) is a measureof the departure from conformality at the asymptoticAdS boundary,z →0, and should grow for large val-ues of z, signaling confinement: It acts as an effectivecoupling in AdS space. We can use the procedure intro-duced in [158] to obtain theµ dependence αAdS/QCDsfrom the Hankel transform of the dilaton factor [158]αAdS/QCDs (µ) ∼∫ ∞0zdzJ0(zµ)e−λz2∼e−µ2/4λ,(5.6.1)where the overall normalization is not provided withinAdS/QCD. The freezing value of the effective couplingαEC,g1s (0) = π is used. The dilaton profileλz2 is deter-minedbythesuperconformalstructure(Sec. 5.5.7).Thetransition between the predicted Gaussian form (5.6.1)and the log behavior expected from pQCD is deter-mined from the matching of the perturbative and non-perturbative couplings and their derivatives for√λ =0.534 GeV . The specific matching allows us to deter-mine the perturbative QCD scale Λ in terms of thehadronic mass scale√λ [1150] for any choice of renor-malization scheme, including theMS scheme [1091].
The couplings αAdS/QCDs , αPI,Pinchs and αEC,g1s areshown in Fig.5.6.1. When compared in the same renor-malization scheme, they agree reasonably well with ear-lierdeterminations,suchas αgse,PTs orthatoftheGodfrey-Isgur quark model [735], see Sec.5.1 and Refs. [1091,1128]. The couplings in Fig.5.6.1 are in close agreementand have been used in the derivation of many crucialnonperturbative quantities, including the QCD scaleΛMSs [1151], as well as elastic and transition form fac-tors [1152–1154], parton distributions (including gen-eralized ones) [844, 1026, 1155–1158], the hadron massspectrum[ 1150,1159],orthepiondecayconstant[ 1159].
In summary, several definitions of the strong cou-pling in the nonperturbative domain are possible. Mostare scheme and gauge dependent. They tend to van-ish as µ →0 in a non-freezing behavior,viz the QCDβ-function itself does not vanish. This informs us onhow quark, gluon and ghost fields interact at low en-ergy in the chosen scheme, but does not directly pro-vide a universal parameter reflecting QCD’s strength.
In contrast, a set of calculations [158, 1143] and phe-nomenological extractions [1117, 1145, 1146] based onthe effective charge prescription [146], following that ofQED [1127], provide observable couplings that agreewhich each other. The consistency of these various ap-proaches in determining a single couplingαSE,g1s ≃αAdS/QCDs ≃αPI,Pinchsand its success in computing a wide range of nonper-turbative quantities suggest that a compelling candi-date for a canonical nonperturbative QCD coupling hasbeen identified. It freezes at low energy, a satisfactorybehavior since in the nonperturbative domain, the cou-pling should be finite and non-vanishing, determined bythe physics of color confinement and its scale parametershould be set by a typical hadronic mass, e.g., that ofthe nucleon. An infrared fixed point is in fact a naturalconsequence of color confinement: since the propaga-tors of the colored fields have a maximum wavelength,all loop integrals in the computation of the gluon self-energy should decouple atQ2 →0 [1160].

In the same year, the one-loop function was calculated[48, 49, 1161, 1162] indicating that that the theory wasasymptotically free, but also implying that the cou-pling constant grew at low momenta. This meant thatperturbation theory in the coupling à la QED is in-applicable for low momentum observables such hadronmasses, charge radii and the like. The following year ’tHooft[1163] proposed an entirely new expansion for thetheory — an expansion in1/Nc where Nc is the num-ber of colors—which, it was hoped, would allow for asystematic computation of these observables.
While the dream of using the 1/Nc expansion tocompute these quantities directly for QCD in 3+1 di-mensions has been elusive, the1/Nc expansion and theassociated large Nc limit has played a significant roleduringthepasthalfcenturyinatleastthreeways:ithasprovided a tool for the theoretical exploration of modelsbeyond QCD, including most famously, the AdS/CFTconnection[1000, 1003] forN= 4 super Yang-Mills; ithas has provided a qualitative and occasionally semi-quantitative tool to understand a significant amountof phenomenology (for example in Ref. [1164]); and, ithas provided an organizing principle for deciding whichtermsshouldbelargeinphenomenological modelsoref-fectivefieldtheorytreatments(forexampleinRef.[ 1165]).
The underlying idea of the1/Nc expansion is thatthree is sufficiently large so that a multicolored worldwith arbitrarily many colors is sufficiently close to thephysical world — at least for some observables of in-terest — that the Nc →∞ world is a good startingpoint for an expansion and that systematic1/Nc cor-rections are controllable. This section will provide anelementary introduction to the largeNc limit and1/Ncexpansion with an emphasis on the underlying founda-tional ideas of the subject. An excellent review of thesefoundational ideas can be found in Sidney Coleman’sErice lectures[1166]; a more modern review of the largeNc limit and1/Nc expansion for field theories with anemphasis on lattice results can be found in Ref. [1167],while a review of largeNc baryon spectroscopy can befound in Ref. [1168].
5.7.1 Large Nc scalingThe key to ’t Hooft’s analysis [1163] were two relatedinsights. The first is that a smooth largeNc limit de-pends on the QCD coupling,g, scaling withNc asg2 = λ/Nc (5.7.1)where λ is independent ofNc. Superficially, this mightseem like a weak coupling limit that justifies standardperturbation theory. However, it does not: color fac-tors in loops grow withNc and can compensate for thesmall coupling. The second key insight was related tothe color factors in loops. ’t Hooft developed a cleverdouble line notation for gluons that allows one to easilyanalyze the scaling behavior of Feynman diagrams. Thenotation exploits the fact that that gluona are in theadjoint representation: they are associated with colormatrices with two indices–one carrying one fundamen-tal color and the other anti-fundamental color. Thus ifone ignores the fact that the matrices are traceless (a1/N2c effect), the color carried by a gluon propagatoris identical to that of a quark line side-by side with ananti-quark line. For the purposes of counting color fac-tors at leading order in1/Nc — and for that purposeonly — it is legitimate to replace gluon propagators inFeynman diagrams with parallel quark-antiquark lines.
A closed loop of fundamental or antifundamental colorin a diagram corresponds to one factor ofNc since thereare Nc fundamental colors.
Armed with this, it is straightforward to deduce thefollowing asymptotic scaling behavior for connected di-agrams with no external lines:– Planar connected diagrams of gluons (diagrams inwhich, except at vertices gluon lines do not crosswhen written in a plane ) and with no external linesgrow asymptotically withNc as N2c.
– A diagram containing a non-planar gluon line re-duces the asymptoticNc scaling of a planar diagramby a factor ofN−2c . Multiple non-planar gluons re-duce the Nc counting by a factor of at leastN−2cper non-planar gluon.
– A planar diagram that contains quark loops thatformtheboundaryofthediagram,reducestheasymp-totic Nc scaling by a factor ofN−1c per quark looprelative to a purely gluonic diagram. Quark loopsthat cannot be written in this form reduce theNcscaling by larger amounts.
Note that planar diagrams containing gluons canstill be very complicated and can contain arbitrarilymany gluon propagators. The fact that planar diagramsof gluons generically scale asN2c can be understood inthe following way: a closed loop consisting of a singlegluon line scales asN2c: in double line form, it has twoloops. Any planar diagram of gluons can be constructedstarting from this single gluon loop: simply add planargluons to it one-by-one until one has the diagram ofinterest. It is easy to see that any planar gluon addedto a previous planar diagram in this construction addsone additional color loop (for a factor ofNc) but alsotwo factors of the coupling constantg at the verticeswhere the new gluons couple to the old diagram; sinceg2 ∼1/Nc this cancels the additional color loop factor154 5 APPROXIMATE QCDpreserving the asymptotic scaling asN2c. By inductionall diagrams of this class scale asymptotically asN2c.
The fact that adding a non-planar diagram reducesthe scaling by a factor ofN−2c can be understood ina similar way. If one starts with a planar diagram ofgluons and adds a non-planar gluon to it, the numberof color loop factors decreases by one for a suppressionfactor of 1/Nc while two additional factors ofg mustbe added for another factor of1/Nc. Thus for exam-ple a diagram with a single non-planar gluon will scaleasymptotically asN0c.
Similarly the scaling of diagrams containing quarkloops that form the boundary of the diagram can beunderstood by noting that such diagrams can alwaysbe obtained starting from a planar diagram of gluonsand then inserting a quark loop into a gluon propaga-tor. Doing so does not change the number of color loopfactors but adds two coupling coupling constants foreach quark loop which together scale asN−1c per quarkloop.
The scaling rules for diagrams allow one to deducethe asymptotic scaling for the properties of glueballsand mesons[1163, 1169]. This can be done via the studyof correlators of local gauge-invariant operators,J, thatcarry the quantum numbers of the glueballs or mesonsof interest. For concreteness, considerJ to be a quarkbilinear such asJ = qq for the case of mesons (wherefor simplicity spin and flavor will be neglected in thediscussion as they do not affect theNc scaling) and anoperator such as J = FaµνFaµν for the case of glue-balls. The correlator can be obtained by inserting theseoperators into closed loop diagrams. Doing so does notalter the leadingNc scaling of the diagram. Thus if oneis studying correlators carrying glueball quantum num-bers, then the leading diagrams scale asN2c; similarlyif one is studying a correlator carrying meson quantumnumbers, then one needs to have a quark loop in thediagram and the leading diagram scales asNc.
Consider the two-point correlation function:ΠJ(q2) = −i∫d4xe−iqµxµ⟨T(J(x)J(0))⟩=∫ds ρ(s)q2 −s+ iϵ(5.7.2)where up to an overall factorρ(s), the spectral den-sity, is given by the imaginary part of the correlator. Itscales withNc in the same way as the correlator. Thecontributions to the spectral density from a given dia-gram can be extracted from its imaginary part. More-over, cutting a diagram at various points between thesourcesrevealsthegluonandquarkcontributionstotheimaginary part, which by construction will form colorsinglet combinations. Using the double line notation, itis easy to see that no matter where the diagrams arecut between the sources, at leading order in1/Nc all ofthe quark and gluons indices contract into a single colorsinglet combination —i.e. one that cannot be brokeninto multiple color singlet combinations.
If additionally one assumes confinement in the mostbasic sense that all asymptotic states are color singlets,this means that at leading order in the1/Nc expan-sion, the operator J creates single hadron states. Bymatching the Nc counting of the leading diagram tothe propagation of a single hadron one sees that⟨meson|Jmeson|vac⟩∼ Nc⟨glueball|Jglueball|vac⟩∼ N2c(5.7.3)Withthisonecandeducenumerousproperties[ 1163,1169] of QCD as a theory of hadrons by matching cor-relators at the quark-gluon level to descriptions at thehadronic level. One finds:– The masses of mesons and glueballs become inde-pendent ofNc as Nc →∞.
– Mesons and glueballs become stable asNc →∞.
– Thephysicsofmesonsandglueballscanbedescribedby an effective tree-level theory with vertices thatscale at leading order asN2−ng−12 nmc , wherenm andng are the number of meson lines and gluon linesrespectively at the vertex. This implies that1. Interactions between these hadrons are weak.
2. Meson decay amplitudes scale asymptotically asN−1/2c and their widths as N−1c . Glueball de-cay amplitudes scale asN−1c and their widths asN−2c3. Meson-mesonscatteringamplitudesscaleas 1/Nc.
Glueball-glueball scattering amplitudes scale as1/N2c,whilemeson-glueballscatteringamplitudesscales as1/Nc.
4. In decays of hadrons into mesons, when all elseis equal, processes with fewer mesons as decayproducts are favored by powers ofNc. Thus forexample the partial decay width of a meson intoa ρ-meson and a pion scales as1/Nc while therate into three pions directly scales as1/N2c.
– There are an infinite number of distinct mesons foreach quantum number. This can be seen by match-ing the correlator to one at large space-likeq2 whichcan be computed perturbatively [1169].
– Quantumnumberexotichybridmesons(stateswhosequantum numbers cannot be obtained as a quark-antiquark state in a simple quark model but requireat least one additional gluon) behave like ordinarymesons in Nc scaling[1170]. At large Nc they arenarrow, there are an infinite number of them for anyquantum number and their interactions with each5.7 The ’t Hooft model and largeN QCD 155other and with other mesons and glueballs scale ac-cording to the same rules as ordinary mesons.
– The OZI rule[18, 1171, 1172] becomes exact in thelarge Nc limit. This implies glueball-meson mixingis suppressed.
– Tetraquark states do not exist at largeNc [1169,1173].
These properties can be viewed as predictions ofQCD: they specify which quantities are dominant as-suming that the largeNc world is a reasonable proxyfor our world. But, at best they make qualitative pre-dictions since the coefficients multiplying the leadingterms in the expansion are not specified by this anal-ysis. Moreover in the physical worldNc is only threeso one might expect that assuming dominance of theleading-order predictions of the1/Nc expansion wouldat best be a crude description of the phenomenology.
In addition, the extent to which the phenomenology isqualitatively described by the leading-order behaviordepends on the observable in question.
In the meson sector the largeNc world might wellbe considered as a crude but recognizable caricatureof much of the observed Nc = 3 phenomenology, atleast for meson constructed from light quarks. Thereare numerous mesons that are comparative narrow —with widths much smaller than masses. There are oftenseveral identified mesons in a single spin-isospin-paritychannels; presumably the number of identifiable mesonwould increase ifNc were made larger. The OZI ruleis typically well satisfied phenomenologically; indeed itwas proposed based on phenomenological grounds be-fore the formulation of QCD[18, 1171, 1172].
While many qualitative aspects aspects of mesonphysics can be deduced from the behavior of the theoryat large Nc, there are observables in the meson sectorfor which subleading effects are sufficiently large thatthe leading behavior in a1/Nc expansion does not de-scribe the physical world even qualitatively. For exam-ple, the would-be nonet of pseduo-Goldstone bosons; anonet would exist if the OZI-rule held — as it does atlarge Nc. However experimentally there is an octet splitfrom a much heavierη′ meson. Of course this splittingis related to topology and the axial anomaly[1174], butin a largeNc world these effects would be suppressedby an overall factor ofN−2c [1175]. The fact that in thephysical world the splitting is large shows that the largeNc world is quite different from ours for this observable.
In fact, there are large classes of observables forwhich the the largeNc world appears to be quite dif-ferent from theNc = 3 world. At largeNc there shouldbe a very large number of species of narrow glueballsthat are weakly mixed with mesons. However, in thephysical of world of Nc = 3 there are comparativelyfew glueball candidates[278] and the evidence for suchstates is typically somewhat murky, either because theevidence of the resonance is weak or because of mix-ing with ordinary mesons makes their “glueball” statusunclear. Indeed, the identification of a resonance as aglueball may depend on there being an “extra” isoscalarstate compared to what one expects from a naive quarkmodel. Nevertheless, largeNc analysis of glueballs is ofvalue at a theoretical level and to a limited extent alsoacts to inform phenomenology: by providing a regime inwhich narrow, weakly mixed glueballs must exist, mini-mally it demonstrates that there is nothing in the basicstructure of gauge theories containing both light quarkand gluon degrees of freedom that forbids the existenceof glueball states.
In a a similar way, the spectrum of quantum num-ber exotic hybrid mesons in nature look quite differ-ent than in a largeNc world: there are few candidatesfor such hadrons carrying light quarks quantum num-bers[278]. Moreover, the evidence for those candidatesis also typically murky due to inconclusive evidence fora resonance. Again the largeNc analysis demonstratesthat there is nothing in the basic structure of gaugetheories forbidding hybrid mesons. LargeNc also pre-dicts that there should not be resonances in tetraquarkchannels. However, a clear signal for a quantum numberexotic tetraquark has recently been found[1071]. As ithappens this state is associated with heavy quarks — itis a doubly charmed state — and it is easy to see thatheavy quark limit and the largeNc limits are not ex-pected to commute for these channels. If one increasedNc while keeping the quark masses fixed, it is expectedthat this state would disappear.
5.7.2 The ’t Hooft modelThe Nc scaling rules presented above can be thoughtof as predictions about the physical world, but only ina qualitative sense — and they fail, even qualitatively,for many observables. Initially it was hoped that the1/Nc expansion could be used as the basis of a quan-titative treatment that was largely analytic at low or-der, in much the same as a expansion inα provided aquantitative treatment of QED. However, for QCD in3+1 dimensions this has not worked out: even at low-est order in the expansion, the theory has proved tobe intractable. Interestingly, however, QCD in 1+1 di-mension, the so-called ’t Hooft model[1057] was solved(initially for one flavor) at leading order in the expan-sion in the early 1970s.
Notethatthelarge Nc scalingargumentsgivenabovedid not depend on QCD being in 3+1 dimensions; they156 5 APPROXIMATE QCDshould hold in 1+1 dimension as well. Thus, one can usethe explicit solutions of the ’t Hooft model as a way tocheck the self-consistency of these rules.
The ’t Hooft model has a critical property in com-mon with QCD — confinement. It is useful to recall,however, that the mechanism of confinement in 1+1 di-mensions is very different than in 3+1 dimensions. Itoccurs for a rather trivial reason — electric flux linescannot spread out and thus even electrodynamics isconfining in 1+1 dimension. The physics of gauge fieldsin 1+1 dimensions is also very simple: the field strengthtensor,Fµν,hasanelectriccomponent E = F01 = −F10but no magnetic component. Thus in 1+1 dimensionalQED, the gauge field is not associated with a propagat-ing photon; the Euler-Lagrange equation for the gaugefield is not dynamical, but simply an equation of con-straint fixing the electric field from the charge densityj0 = ψγ0ψ. This is because the Gauss law (plus someconditions at infinity) fully determines the electric field.
Something completely analogous occurs in the ’t Hooftmodel.
While the color electric field in QCD in 1+1 dimen-sion can be fixed given the color charge density of thequarks, the gauge field,Aµ, itself depends on making agauge choice. Certain gauges, such as the axial gaugeof A1 = 0 or the light-cone gauge have a particular use-ful property: they automatically suppress gluon-gluoncouplings. In the axial gauge this is clear since all ofthe nonlinear terms involve products of A1 and A0.
Gluon-gluon couplings vanish in the light-cone gaugefor similar reasons. Since it is these non-linear couplingsthat make QCD complicated, QCD in 1+1 dimensionsgreatly simplifies.
The ’t Hooft model simplifies further at leading or-der in the1/Nc expansion. The leading diagrams for thejµ correlator (which carries meson quantum numbers)are planar with a single quark loop bounding the dia-gram. This means that no gluon lines can either cross(due to the largeNc constraint ) nor interact (due tothe lack of gluon-gluon interactions. Accordingly thecorrelator is given by the so-called rainbow-ladder ap-proximation: each quark propagator has a self-energygiven by the sum of rainbow diagrams, while the in-teractions between quark lines is the the sum of ladderdiagrams. The sum of these diagrams can be reducedanalytically to integral equation between spinor-valuedobjects.
Thesesimplifyfurtherintosimpleintegralequationsif one uses the light-cone gauge, which is based on light-cone coordinates:x± = x0 ±x1√2 (5.7.4)and has a metric given byg+− = g−+ = 1 and g++ =g−− = 0. The light cone gauge condition isA− = A+ = 0 ; (5.7.5)among other things it has the virtue of being Lorentzinvariant.
At leading order in largeNc the spectral functionfor this correlator is expected to be saturated by ar-bitrarily narrow meson states. Since the explicit formof the correlator is calculable, one can develop a light-cone Bethe-Salpeter type eigenvalue equation forµ2 themeson mass, andψ(K), the light-cone Bethe-Salpeteramplitude for the meson. It is given in terms of a light-cone momentum,K appropriately scaled so thatψ(K)vanishes atK = 0 and K = 1 and ψ(K) is only definedfor 0 ≤K ≤1. It is given by the following integralequationµ2nψn(K) = m2 −g2πK(1 −K)ψn(K)−g2π∫ 10dK′ P(K−K′)2 ψn(K′)(5.7.6)where Pindicates principal value,µn is the meson massfor thenth meson, ψn(K) is the Bethe-Salpeter ampli-tude for that state,m is the quark mass andg is thecouplingconstant(whichhasdimensionsofmassin1+1dimensions).
While there is no analytic solution to this integraleigenvalue equation, it can easily be solved numeri-cally to give the meson spectrum for the model. Notethat Nc is not present in this expression showing self-consistently that meson masses are independent ofNcat largeNc as deduced from general scaling rules.
The fact thatψ(K) vanishes at theK = 0 and K =1 implies that the spectrum will be discrete — thereare no solutions corresponding to two free quarks; themodel correctly incorporates confinement. It is easy toshow that for all values ofm and g, µ2 is real. Thisshows self-consistently that mesons are stable at largeNc and verifies the general analysis discussed above.
Moreover it can be shown thatµ2 is always positive,showing that no matter how large the coupling,g, thereare no tachyonic states that would signal an instability.
For asymptotically large values of n, it is easy tofind the eigenvectors and Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes:µn = g2πn , ψ(K) = sin( nπK) . (5.7.7)This asymptomatic form shows that solutions exist forarbitrarily highn, indicating the self-consistency of thelarge Nc analysis, which predicted that there are aninfinite number of mesons at largeNc.5.7 The ’t Hooft model and largeN QCD 157The limit of zero quark mass in the ’t Hooft modelat largeNc is interesting as it provides an opportunityto study chiral symmetry and its spontaneous break-ing[1176]. The regime in which chiral symmetry break-ing takes place requires that care be taken in the or-dering of limits. One must take the limit ofNc →∞(with the ’t Hooft coupling,g2Nc, held fixed), prior tothe m →0 limit. This limiting procedure insures thatthe ratio gm goes to zero in the combined limit. In thislimit, it can be shown[1176], that chiral condensate isgiven by⟨qq⟩= −Nc√g2Nc12π . (5.7.8)Thus the ’t Hooft model provides a simple illustrationof how chiral symmetry breaking can work in a gaugetheory.
However, the nature of spontaneous chiral symme-try breaking in the ’t Hooft model is rather subtle. Notethat the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is aviolation of Coleman’s theorem[1177] which rules outspontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous sym-metry for theories in 1+1 dimensions. Thus, sponta-neous chiral symmetry breaking seems paradoxical.
The resolution of the paradox was provided by Wit-ten[1178] in his analysis of an analogous problem: spon-taneouschiralsymmetrybreakingintheThirringmodelat largeNc. It turns out that that the spontaneous chi-ral symmetry breaking is an artifact of working at in-finitely largeNc from the outset; it is absent for any fi-niteNc,nomatterhowlarge.Thus,asthelarge Nc limitis approached the condensate is always strictly zero andthere are no Goldstone bosons. However, the theory isin a Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase[1179,1180] inwhich the symmetry is “almost broken” and correlationfunctions ofqq behave in a nontrival way. For space-likeseparations⟨T[qq(x,t)qq(0,0)]⟩∼ (x2 −t2)constNc . (5.7.9)One sees that for any finite Nc correlation functionsqq fall off at large distance and thus do not saturateas they would if a condensate had formed. However,they also do not fall off exponentially as they wouldif qq created massive particles. Instead, there are long-range correlations: the correlation functions fall as apower law with distance. Moreover, the power dependson Nc in such a way that it goes to zero at infiniteNc.
Thus if one takesNc to be infinite at the outset, thesystemsactsasthoughspontaneoussymmetrybreakinghad occurred.
The large Nc properties of glueballs deduced ear-lier cannot be checked in the ’t Hooft model for a verysimple reason: in 1+1 dimension there are no glueballs.
5.7.3 BaryonsOf course mesons, glueballs and hybrids are not theonly hadrons, there are also baryons. Unfortunately,the direct study of correlation functions via diagram-matic methods as was done for meson and glueballsdoes not work for baryons. This is for an obvious rea-son: a baryon contains (at least)Nc quarks so that thenumber of quark lines in diagrams must grow withNc.
Among other things, this destroys the dominance ofplanar diagrams.
Witten argued that one can deduce the correct scal-ing behavior of largeNc baryons by first considering thecase in which all of the quarks are heavy (with massesmuch larger than the QCD scale) [1169]. In that sit-uation, quark-antiquark pairs are suppressed and thepropagation of quarks is non-relativistic. At the mosttrivial level, it ought to be apparent that in this regimeMbaryon ≈NcMQ where MQ is the mass of a heavyquark: the dominant term in the mass of a nonrela-tivistic system is the mass of the constituents and thebaryoncontains Nc quarks.Thusthemassofthebaryonscaling of the baryon mass withNc isMbaryon ∼Nc . (5.7.10)Of course this result is from the leading term ina combined expansion built around the heavy quarkand large Nc limits with the heavy quark limit takenfirst; one might worry that the limits do not commutefor the baryon mass. However, it is straightforward tosee that subleading terms in a1/MQ expansion of thebaryon mass also have a leading-order term in theNcexpansion that scales likeNc. This suggests that thisscaling could be general and hold independently of thequark mass. To see how this comes about, recall thatin a heavy quark expansion for the baryon mass, theleading term — the direct quark mass contribution —is essentially not dynamical; the dominant subleadingterms overall are the leading dynamical ones. The ef-fective heavy quark lagrangian includes a nonrelativis-tic kinetic energy for the quarks and a color-Coulombinteraction between them. Witten[1169] demonstratedthat at largeNc, the Hartree mean-field approximationto the non-relativistic color Coulomb problem becomesexact. In the Hartree approximation, correlations areneglected and each quark sits in an effective 1-body po-tential derived from interactions with the otherNc−1quarks (which sit in the ground state of the same po-tential).
Since the color-Coulomb interaction between twoquarks has two factors of the coupling constantg, itscales as 1/Nc. The mean-field Hamiltonian between158 5 APPROXIMATE QCDone quark and the remainder has that quark interact-ing withNc−1 quarks and interactions add coherently.
Thus, the mean-field Hamiltonian scales as(Nc−1)/Ncand at asymptotically largeNc becomes independent ofNc. The one-body equation for a single quark is thenindependent ofNc at largeNc and the quark’s groundstate wave function is also independent of Nc. Thismeans that the spatial extent of the Hartree potential isitself independent ofNc. The contribution of the kineticenergy to the mass scales as isNc since there areNcquarks. The potential energy contributes12 Nc⟨VHartree⟩,where ⟨VHartree⟩is the expectation value of the mean-field potential for a single quark; the factor of12 is be-cause the interaction energy in a pair of quarks is splitbetween them. Thus the direct quark mass term, thekinetic energy term and interaction term all scale lin-early with Nc, strongly suggesting thatMbaryon ∼Ncindependent of the quark mass.
Moreover there is a very powerful argument fromWitten[1169] that the results deduced from this mean-field behavior should persist when the quarks are light.
Formally one would need to start with a relativisticmany-bodyequationforboundstates—atypeofBethe-Salpeter equation generalized to many particles — andshow that the analog of the Hartree approximation be-comes exact in the largeNc limit. While that would betechnicallyquitecomplicated,itseemsapparentthatallof the scaling from the Hartree approximation for heavyquarks should go through provided that irreducible n-bodyinteractionsbetweenquarksscalesas Nn−1c .Ifthisis true it is easy to see that the analog of the Hartreepotential will be independent ofNc: at asympoticallylarge Nc: there are Nc 2-body interactions that eachscale as 1/Nc, N2c three-body interactions that eachscaleas 1/N2c,N3c fourbody-interactionsthateachscaleas 1/N3c and so forth. Each of these has a net contribu-tion that is independent ofNc indicating that this gen-eralized mean-field interaction for a single quark is in-dependent ofNc. Moreover demonstrating that n-bodyinteractions between quarks scales asNn−1c is straight-forward using diagrammatic arguments similar to thoseused for the glueball and meson sectors.
Using this Hartree picture it is possible to deduce[1169] the asymptotic scaling of numerous baryon prop-erties:– Ground state baryon masses scale asymptotically asNc.
– The size of ground state baryons generically is inde-pendent ofNc. Explicitly this means that form fac-tors of external currents for baryons (such as electricfactors) generically scale asN0cf(q2/N0c); for q2 oforder N0c the form factor is independent ofNc. Thisin turn means the moments of distributions (whichare related to derivatives of form factors) such as⟨r2⟩, ⟨r4⟩are independent ofNc at largeNc.
– Generic couplings between a ground state baryonand nmesons scale asN1−n/2c . Among other thingsthis means that1. Meson-baryoncouplingsscalegenericallyas N1/2c .
2. Meson-baryon scattering amplitudes are generi-cally independent ofNc for largeNc– Couplings between a meson, a ground state baryonand an excited baryon are generically independentof Nc and excited baryons have widths that are in-dependent ofNc. Unlike in the glueball and mesonsectors, these states are not narrow at largeNc, norcan you can conclude that there an infinite numberof them.
Witten observed[1169] an interesting pattern to thescaling properties for baryons given above. They scaleasymptotically with 1/Nc in the same way as analo-gous properties of solitons scale a with coupling con-stants squared. This insight lead to a renaissance of in-terest[1181–1183]intheSkyrmemodel[ 1184]asamodelas baryonsThe scaling laws given above are generic. Spin andflavor considerations may act to suppress certain cou-plings below these generic results. Moreover, for thecase of two or more degenerate flavors, the notion of“ground state baryon” becomes a bit involved. Bothof these issues are related to an emergent spin-flavorsymmetry — a symmetry that is not manifest in theQCD langrangian but emerges at largeNc. In general,this symmetry is a contractedSU(2Nf) where Nf isthe number of degenerate light flavors — it reduces toSU(4) if one considers the up and down quarks to be ef-fectively degenerate and the strange quark much heav-ier.
An initial hint that a new symmetry beyond mereisospin symmetry was emergent at largeNc could beseen in the 2-flavor Skyrme model[1181], treated clas-sically (with requanitzed collective coordinates to re-store broken symmetries). This treatment correspondsto leading order in the1/Nc expansion. It was foundthat rather than having the nucleon as the sole groundstate, one had a tower of states withI = J (the firsttwo being the nucleon (I = 12 ,J = 12 ) and the ∆(I = 32 ,J = 32 ) with the levels in the tower degener-ate at leading order in1/Nc [1181]; the splittings canbe shown to beO(N−1c ). Moreover, it was found thatthe ratios of the values of certain observables held in-dependently of the parameters of the model or even theprecise form of the Skyrme Lagrangian[1185]. It was re-alized that this behavior was not a property of Skyrmemodels per se but rather reflected an underlying sym-metry of baryons[1186–1188].5.7 The ’t Hooft model and largeN QCD 159The symmetry can be seen to be required for theconsistency[1187] of largeNc scaling provided that thepion-nucleon coupling scales withNc generically—i.e.
as N1/2c . With this scaling, the Born approximationfor pion-nucleon nucleon would scale linearly withNc.
However, unitarity constrains the scattering amplitudesto scale no faster than N0c. Clearly, something mustcancel the Born amplitude in any channel where themeson-baryon coupling scales generically. In the caseof scalar-isoscalar mesons, it is easy to show that theheavy mass of the baryon at largeNc implies that atleading order, the contribution of the cross-Born di-agram cancels the contribution of the Born diagram.
However, pions are derivatively coupled and hence cou-ple to the spin of the nucleon and are isovector so theyalso couple to the isospin. The various components ofspin do not commute with each other and similarly withthe various components of isospin and as a result, thecancellation between the Born and cross-Born contribu-tions toπ−N scattering appears to be spoiled. How-ever, the cancellation between the Born and cross-Borncontributions at the level of pion-nucleon scattering willbe restored provided that the∆is treated as being de-generate (at this order) with the nucleon and the ratioof gπN∆ (the transition coupling between the pion thenucleon and the∆) is taken to be a prescribed numbertimes gπNN[1187]. Applying the same logic to the pro-cessπ+N →π+∆,requires gπ∆∆ tobeafixedmultipleof gπN∆. At this order in1/Nc, the∆ and the nucleonare degenerate and the∆ should be treated as stable.
Thus one can legitimately considerπ −∆ scattering.
Applying the same logic, one deduces the existence ofa degenerateI = 52 ,J = 52 baryon and so forth gener-ating a tower of states that become degenerate at largeNc. Presumably the the nucleon and∆correspond ap-proximately to the observed states in theN = 3 world,while theI = 52 ,J = 52 is a largeNc artifact.
It is possible to show that the structure describedabove is encoded in a contractedSU(4) Lie algebra fortwo-flavor QCD. The fixed ratio of the coupling con-stants are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients ofthe group. The same logic that gives rise to the con-tracted SU(4) symmetry, gives a contractedSU(6) for3-flavor QCD to the extent that one can approximatethe strange quark as being nearly degenerate with theup and down quarks[1188]. Moreover, it is possible toshow that for certain observables the leading correc-tions to the the contracted SU(2Nf) symmetry is oforder 1/N2c rather than 1/Nc[1189]. This fact allowsone to make some semi-quantitative predictions basedontheemergentsymmetryencodedinthelarge Nc limitfor baryons. A good example of this are the mass rela-tions of Ref. [1164].
5.7.4 Nucleon-nucleon interactions and nuclearphysicsThe study of nucleon-nucleon interactions is compli-cated for kinematical reasons associated with the largenucleon mass. There are two kinematic regimes of in-terest: one in which the momentum transfers are inde-pendent of Nc and the other in which the momentumtransfers are of order Nc — i.e. in which the veloci-ties are independent ofNc. Physical observables asso-ciated with nucleon-nucleon scattering do not have asmooth large Nc in the regime in which momentumtransfers are of order N0c, but an analysis based ona time-dependent Hartree picture suggests that somescattering observables will have smooth largeNc lim-its[1169] in the regime of momentum transfers of orderNc. These observables do not include many standardscattering observables such as phase shifts; the onesthat have smooth limits appear to be those in whichone follows the bulk flow of quantities of interest[1190].
Presumably the total cross-section also has a smoothlimit[1191]. There is some predictive power for the spinand flavor dependence of such observables owing to thecontracted SU(4) symmetry[1190, 1191].
In the regime in which momentum transfers are oforder unity — the regime of relevance to nuclear struc-ture — the logic of Ref. [1169] implies that the nucleon-nucleon interaction strength is of order Nc, which isformally of the same order as the nucleon mass, whileits range is independent ofNc. This implies that nu-clear matter would be crystalline at largeNc, with nu-cleons constrained to be near the minimum of the po-tential from other nucleons. This is radically differentfrom what is seen nature, suggesting that a1/Nc ex-pansion around the largeNc limit is not a useful ap-proach to nuclear structure. Interestingly, however, ifone focuses solely on the spin-flavor structure of thenucleon-nucleon potential — a quantity that is not di-rectly physical — there is a hierarchy in the strengthof various spin-flavor contributions. This hierarchy isqualitatively similar to what one would obtain fromthe contractedSU(4) spin-flavor symmetry of largeNcQCD[1192,1193]. This behavior is consistent with whatone would expect if the nucleon-nucleon force was de-scribed via meson exchanges, as has been typically donein nuclear physics. Since the overall potential strengthat the one-meson exchange level is large in some chan-nels,consistencyrequiressubtlecancellationswhenmul-tiple-meson exchange are included. Such cancellationsnaturally occur due to the contractedSU(4) symme-try[1194].160 5 APPROXIMATE QCD5.7.5 Other large Nc limitsThe large Nc limit of QCD is an extrapolation fromour world atNc = 3 to a largeNc world. However, thatextrapolationisnotunique.Thestandardapproachdis-cussed above involves keeping the number of flavorsfixed while lettingNc go to infinity. However, there isan alternative, the Venziano limit[1195] in which theratio of the number of colors to the number of flavorsis held fixed asNc →∞. The largeNc world for thesetwo limits are quite different.
There is yet another large Nc limit that exploitsthe fact that at Nc = 3 , the representation for fun-damental color and for the antisymmetric combinationof two antifundamental colors are identical (i.e. r isindistinguishable from(gb−bg)/√2). However quarkswith fundamental color and with two-index antisym-metric color extrapolate to largeNc quite differently —there are Nc distinct quark colors for the former andNc(Nc −1)/2 ∼N2c for the latter.
LargeNc QCD(AS),thelimitbasedonquarksinthetwo-indexantisymmetricrepresentationhasremarkableformal connections supersymmetric QCD[1196–1198].
Phenomenologically,QCD(AS)hasscalingofmesonprop-erties with Nc similar to those of glueballs; one im-portant difference between QCD(AS) at largeNc andthe conventional large Nc limit is that in QCD(AS)quantum number exotic tetraquarks are not forbidden;indeed, they are required [1199]. The description ofbaryons for QCD(AS) is in analogy to Witten’s buta somewhat new type of analysis is required [1200].
Formally, the predictions for baryon spectroscopy aredistinct in QCD(AS) and QCD with quarks in the fun-damental[1201], but phenomenological predictions forboth expansions work to the order expected in describ-ing real world data.
5.8 OPE-based sum rules:SVZ sum rules, 1MQexpansion and all thatMikhail Shifman5.8.1 PreambleRewind to autumn of 1971. I am a student at ITEP inMoscow, working on my Masters degree. The famouspaper of Gerhard ’t Hooft [47] was published in Nu-clear Physics in October, but neither myself nor any-body else in ITEP immediately noticed this ground-breaking publication. At that time I did not even knowwhat Yang-Mills theories meant. Now, when I think ofthe inception of QCD, the memories of this paper andits sequel [46] (issued in December of 1971) always cometo my mind. For me, psychologically this was the be-ginning of the QCD era.
To give an idea of the scientific atmosphere at thattime (1972) I looked through the Proceedings of the1972 International Conference On High-Energy Physics[1202]. Theoretical talks were devoted to dual models(a precursor to string theory), deep inelastic scatteringand Bjorken scaling, current algebra,e+e− →hadrons,etc. In three talks – by Zumino, Bjorken and Ben Lee –the Weinberg-Salam model (a precursor to the present-day Standard Model) was reviewed.46 Ben Lee was theonly person to refer to ’t Hooft’s publications [46, 47].
The last talk of the conference summarizing its majortopics was delivered by Murray Gell-Mann. In this talkGell-Mann discusses, in particular, whether quarks arephysical objects or abstract mathematical constructs.
Most interesting for us is his analysis of theπ0 →2γdecay. Gell-Mann notes that if quarks are fermions thenthe theoretically predicted amplitude is a factor of 3lower than the corresponding experimental result, butmakes no statement of the inevitability of the quarkcolor.47In October 1972 I was accepted to the ITEP grad-uate school. My first paper on deep inelastic scatter-ing in the Weinberg-Salam model was completed inearly 1973; simultaneously, I started studying Yang-Mills theories (in particular, the Faddeev-Popov quan-tization [1203] 48) in earnest. At the same time, some-where far away, behind the Iron Curtain, Callan andGross searched for a theory with an ultraviolet fixedpoint at zero. In July of 1973 Coleman and Gross sub-mitted to PRL a paper asserting that “no renormal-izable field theory that consisted of theories with ar-bitrary Yukawa, scalar or Abelian gauge interactionscould be asymptotically free” [1204]. Damn Iron Cur-tain! If Gross asked anyone from the ITEP TheoryDepartment he would have obtained the answer right46 There is a curious anecdote I heard later: In December1979,aftertheGlashow-Weinberg-SalamNobelPrizeceremony,a program was aired on Swedish radio. At some point, Wein-berg quoted a phrase from the Bible. Salam remarked that itexists in the Quran too, to which Weinberg reacted: “Yes, butwe published it earlier!”47 For me personally the following remark in his talk was agood lesson for the rest of my career: “Last year the rate ofK0L → µ+µ− decay was reported to be lower than allowedby unitarity unless fantastic hypotheses are concocted. Nowthe matter has become experimentally controversial.” Alas...
concocting fantastic hypotheses was the core of my Mastersthesis.

Apparently, in [47], [46] ’t Hooft used the short version while Icould use the longer one.5.8 OPE-based sum rules 161away. The above theorem was known to the ITEP theo-rists from the Landau time. For brevity I will refer to itas the Landau theorem, although it was established byhis students rather than Landau himself. The generalreason why this theorem holds was also known – theKällen-Lehman (KL) representation of the polarizationoperator plus unitarity.
An explanatory remark concerning the Landau the-orem might be helpful here. For asymptotic freedom totake place the first coefficient of theβ function must benegative. The sign of the one-loop graphs which deter-mine the coupling constant renormalization is in one-to-one correspondence with the sign of their imaginaryparts (this is due to the dispersion KL representationfor these graphs). Unitarity implies the positivity ofthe imaginary parts which inevitably leads to thepos-itive first coefficients in theβ functions in renormaliz-able four-dimensional field theories based on arbitraryYukawa, scalar or Abelian gauge interactions. This sit-uation is that of the Landau zero charge in the infraredrather than asymptotic freedom. In Yang-Mills theoriesinphysicalghost-freegaugessomegraphshavenoimag-inary parts which paves the way to asymptotic freedom(see e.g. [1205]).
In fact, it is quite incomprehensible why asymp-totic freedom had not been discovered at ITEP after’t Hooft’s 1971 publication. In Ref. [1205] the readercan find a narrative about this historical curiosity.
May1973shouldbeviewedasthediscoveryofasymp-toric freedom [48, 49]. That’s when the breakthroughpapers of Gross, Wilczek and Politzer were submitted –simultaneously – to PRL. David Gross recollects [1204]:We completed the calculation in a spurt of activ-ity. At one point a sign error in one term con-vinced us that [Yang-Mills] theory was, as ex-pected, non-asymptotically free. As I sat downto put it together and to write up our results, Icaught the error. At almost the same time Politzerfinished his calculation and we compared, throughSidney, our results. The agreement was satisfy-ing.
IttookafewextramonthsforQCDtotakeoffas thetheory of strong interactions. The events of the summerof 1973 that led to the birth of QCD are described byH. Leutwyler in Sec. 1.1 of this Volume. To my mind,the final acceptance came with the November Revolu-tion of 1974 – the discovery ofJ/ψ and its theoreti-cal interpretation as ortho-charmonium.49 In the fall of49 I should also mention a highly motivating argument dueto S. Weinberg who proved [1206] that (in the absence of theU(1) current gluon anomaly) mη′ ≤√3mπ. This argumentseemingly was discussed during ICHEP 74 in July 1974.
1973 we submitted a paper [1207] explaining why theLandau theorem in four dimensions fails only in Yang-Mills theory.
QCD and its relatives are special because QCD isthe theory of nature. QCD is strongly coupled in theinfrared domain where it is impossible to treat it qua-siclassically – perturbation theory fails even qualita-tively. It does not capture the drastic rearrangementof the vacuum structure related to confinement. TheLagrangian is defined at short distances in terms of glu-ons and quarks, while at large distances of the order of≳ Λ−1QCD (where ΛQCD is the dynamical scale of QCD,which I will refer to asΛbelow) we deal with hadrons,e.g. pions,ρ mesons, protons, etc. Certainly, the latterare connected with quarks and gluons in a divine way,but this connection is highly nonlinear and non-local;even now, 50 years later, the full analytic solution ofQCD is absent.
Non-perturbativemethodsweredesperatelyneeded.
5.8.2 Inception of non-perturbative methodsFour years before QCD Ken Wilson published a break-through paper [25] on the operator product expansion(OPE) whose pivotal role in the subsequent develop-ment of HEP theory was not fully appreciated untilmuch later. What is now usually referred to as Wilso-nianrenormalizationgroup(RG),orWilsonianRGflow,grew from this paper. The Wilsonian paradigm of sep-aration of scales in quantum theory was especially suit-able for asymptotically free theories. Wilson’s formula-tion makes no reference to perturbation theory, it has ageneral nature and is applicable in the non-perturbativeregime too. The focus of Wilson’s work was on statis-tical physics, where the program is also known as theblock-spin approach. Starting from microscopic degreesof freedom at the shortest distancesa, one “roughens”them, step by step, by constructing a sequence of effec-tive (composite) degrees of freedom at distances2a, 4a,8a, and so on. At each given stepione constructs an ef-fective Hamiltonian, which fully accounts for dynamicsat distances shorter thanai in the coefficient functions.
QCD required a number of specifications and ad-justments. Indeed, the UV fixed point in QCD is atαs = 0; hence, the approach to this fixed point at shortdistances is very slow, logarithmic rather than power-like, characteristic for theαs ̸= 0 fixed point. In fact, itis not the critical regime at the UV fixed pointper sewe are interested in but rather the regime of approachto this critical point. Moreover, it was not realized that(in addition to the dynamical scaleΛ) the heavy quarksprovide an extra scale – the heavy quark massmQ –which must be included in OPE where necessary.162 5 APPROXIMATE QCDTable 5.8.1The lowest-dimension operators in OPE.Γ is a generic notation for combinations of the Diracγ matrices.

On the theoretical side, it was discussedalmost exclusively in perturbation theory. On the prac-tical side, its applications were mostly narrowed downto deep inelastic scattering, where it was customary towork in theleading-twist approximation.
The fact that the UV fixed point is at zero makesOPE both more simple and more complicated than inthe general case. On one hand, the anomalous dimen-sions of all composite local operators which might berelevant in the given problem scale only logarithmically.
On the other hand, slow (logarithmic) fall off of “tails”instead of desired power-like – makes analytic separa-tion of scales technically difficult.
I believe that we – Arkady Vainshtein, Valentin Za-kharov and myself – were the first to start constructinga QCD version of OPE. The first step in this directionwas undertaken in 1974 in the problem of strangeness-changing weak decays [1208, 1209] (currently known asthe penguin mechanism in flavor-changing decays). Amystery of∆I = 12 enhancement inK decays had beenknown for years (for a review see [1210]). A suggestionof how one could apply OPE to solve this puzzle was al-ready present in Wilson’s paper [25]. Wilson naturallylacked particular details of QCD. The first attempt toimplement Wilson’s idea in QCD was made in [1211,1212]. Although these papers were inspirational, theymissed the issue of a “new” OPE needed for QCD real-ities. Seemingly, we were the first to address this chal-lenge, more exactly two of its features: mixed quark-gluon operators (in [1208, 1209] we introducedOpeng = ¯sLγµ(DνGµν) dLwhichispurely ∆I = 12 )andcoefficientslogarithmicallydepending on the charmed (i.e. heavy at that time)quark mass. Currently, c,b,t quark masses appear inthe penguin operators (illustrated in Fig. 5.8.1), thelatter two being genuinely heavy. Through equations ofFig. 5.8.1The penguin mechanism in flavor-changing decays.
Any of three heavy quarksc,b or tcan appear in the loop.
motion the operatorOpeng reduces to a four-quark op-erator but its chiral structure is different from conven-tional, namely, it contains both left-handed and right-handed quark fields since DνGµν ∼ ∑q ¯qγµq. Com-bined with another revolutionary finding of QCD, theextraordinary smallness of theu and d quark masses,mu,d ∼5 MeV (see Sec. 1.1.15), the mixed chiral struc-ture of the emerging four-fermion operator providesthe desired enhancement of the∆I = 12 amplitude. Ittook us over two years to fight a succession of refereesfor publication of Ref. [1209]. One after another, theywould repeat that mixed-chirality four-fermion opera-tor in the considered theory was complete nonsense.
Currently, the penguin mechanism in flavor changingweak transitions is a basic theoretic element for a largevariety of such decays. As Vainshtein put it [1210],“Penguins spread out but have not yet landed.”Systematic studies of Wilsonian OPE in QCD canbe traced back to the summer of 1977 – that is when thegluon condensate OG (see Table5.8.1) was first intro-duced [1213]. Vacuum expectation values of other gluonandquarkoperatorswereintroducedinRef.[ 126],whichallowed one to analyze a large number of vacuum two-and three-point functions, with quite nontrivial resultsfor masses, coupling constants, magnetic moments andother static characteristics of practically all low-lyinghadronic states of mesons and baryons. A consistentWilsonian approach requires an auxiliary normalizationpoint µ which plays the role of a regulating parameterseparatinghardcontributionsincludedinthecoefficientfunctions and soft contributions residing in local opera-tors occurring in the expansion. The degree of localityisregulated by the same parameter. “Hard” versus “soft”means coming from the distances shorter thanµ−1 inthe former case and larger thanµ−1 in the latter.
After setting the foundation of OPE in QCD [126]we were repeatedly returning to elaboration of variousissues,inparticluar,inthefollowingworks:[ 1214],[1215],and [1216].
5.8.3 SVZ sum rules. ConceptsThe 1998 review [1215] summarizes for the reader foun-dationsoftheShifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov(SVZ)sumrules in a pedagogical manner. At short distances QCDis the theory of quarks and gluons. Yang-Mills the-ory of gluons confines. This means that if you have aheavy probe quark and an antiquark at a large sep-aration, a flux tube with a constant tension develops5.8 OPE-based sum rules 163between them, preventing their “individual” existence.
In the absence of the probe quarks, the flux tube canform closed contours interpreted as glueballs. This phe-nomenon is also referred to in the literature as the arealaw or the dual Meißner effect. Until 1994 the abovepicture was the statement of faith. In 1994 Seibergand Witten found an analytic proof [1217, 1218] ofthe dual Meißner effect inN = 2 super-Yang-Mills.50The Seiberg-Witten solution doesnot apply to QCD,rather to its distant relative. The real world QCD, withquarks, in fact has no area law (the genuine confine-ment is absent) since the flux tubes break through thequark-antiquark pair creation. Moreover, light quarksare condensed, leading to a spontaneous breaking ofchiral symmetry, a phenomenon shaping the propertiesofthelow-lyinghadronicstates,bothmesonicandbary-onic. The need to analytically understand these prop-erties from first principles led us to the development ofthe SVZ method.
Thequarkscomprisingthelow-lyinghadronicstates,e.g. classical mesons or baryons, are not that far fromeach other, on average. The distance between them is oforder ofΛ−1. Under the circumstances, the string-likechromoelectricfluxtubes,connectingwell-separatedco-lor charges, do not develop and details of their struc-ture are not relevant. Furthermore, the valence quarkpair injected in the vacuum – or three quarks in thecase of baryons – perturb it only slightly. Then we donot need the full machinery of the QCD strings51 toapproximately describe the properties of the low-lyingstates. Their basic parameters depend on how the va-lence quarks of which they are built interact with typ-ical vacuum field fluctuations.
We endowed the QCD vacuum with various con-densates – approximately a half-dozen of them – inthe hope that this set would be sufficient to describea huge variety of the low-lying hadrons, mesons andbaryons. The original set included52 the gluon conden-sate G2µν, the quark condensate¯qq, the mixed conden-sate ¯qσµνGµνq,variousfour-quarkcondensates ¯qΓq¯qΓq,and a few others (see Table5.8.1). Later this set hadto be expanded to address such problems as, say, themagnetic moments of baryons.
Our task was to determine the regularities and pa-rametersoftheclassicalmesonsandbaryonsfromalim-ited set of the vacuum condensates. Figure5.8.2 graph-ically demonstrates the SVZ concept. On the theoret-50 More exactly, confinement through the flux tube formationwas proven in the low-energy limit of this theory upon addinga small deformation term breakingN = 2 down toN = 1 .

Fig. 5.8.2 A two-point correlation function in the QCD vac-uum. The left side is the OPE sum with a finite number of thelowest-dimension operators ordered according to their normaldimensions. The right side is the sum over mesons with theappropriate quantum numbers. The ground state in the givenchannel is singled out. The excited states are accounted for inthe quasiclassical approximation. We define a positive variableQ2 = −q2 and a slidingµ2 parameter used as a separation pa-rameter in OPE. For better convergence a Borel transformationis applied as explained below.
ical side, an appropriaten-point function is calculatedas an OPE expansion truncated at a certain order. Inmost problems only condensates up to dimension 6 (Ta-ble 5.8.1) are retained. In the “experimental” part thelowest-lying meson (or baryon) is singled out, while allhigher states are represented in the quasiclassical ap-proximation. Above an effective “threshold”s0, wherethe spectral density becomes smooth, we apply quark-hadron duality to replace it by perturbative. Then theparameter s0 is fitted along with the parameters of thelowest lying state – its mass and residue.
Acting in this way, one can determine the parame-ters f0 and m0 defined in Fig.5.8.2 and their analogs inother problems. Of course, without invoking the entireinfinite set of condensates one can only expect to obtainthe hadronic parameters in an admittedly approximatemanner.
5.8.4 BorelizationAnalyzing the sum rules displayed in Fig.5.8.2 we re-alized that their predictive power was limited – sum-mation on both sides of the equation does not convergefast enough. On the right-hand side the contribution ofhigh excitations is too large – the lowest lying states are“screened” – because the weight factors fall off ratherslowly. Likewise, to achieve reasonable accuracy on theleft-hand side one would need to add operators otherthan those collected in Table 5.8.1. At that time weknew next to nothing about higher-dimension opera-tors, of dimension ≳ 7. The Borel transform came tothe rescue.
The Borel transformation is a device well-known inmathematics. If one has a functionf(x) expandable inthe Taylor series, f(x) = x∑nanxn with the coeffi-cients an which do not fall off sufficiently fast, one can164 5 APPROXIMATE QCDFig. 5.8.3 Graph showing four loops renormalizing a gluonline (represented by the dotted line). A renormalon is the sumover nof such diagrams withnloops.
instead introduce its Borel transformBf = x∑nann! xn (5.8.1)and then, if needed, reconstructf.53If we apply this procedure to the sum rule in Fig. 2we obtain for a given hadronic stateiB f2im2i + Q2 = Bf2iQ2∑n(−1)n[m2iQ2]n→ f2iQ2∑n(−1)nn![m2iQ2]n= f2iQ2 exp(−m2iQ2)→ f2iM2 exp(−m2iM2)(5.8.2)where, in the final step (for historical reasons), I re-placed Q2 by a Borel parameter M2. If M2 can bechosen sufficiently small, higher excitations areexpo-nentially suppressed.
Simultaneously, we improve the convergence of OPEon the left-hand side by applying the same operatorB.
If the operator⟨On⟩has dimension2dn, then the Borelltransformation of the left hand side yieldsB∑n1(Q2)dn⟨On⟩→∑n1(dn −1)!1(M2)dn⟨On⟩,(5.8.3)where I have again replacedQ2 by the Borel parameterM2. Since the expansion (5.8.3) goes in inverse pow-ers of M2, it is necessary to keep M2 large enough.
The two requirements onM2 seem contradictory. How-ever, for all “typical” resonances, such as sayρmesons,they can be met simultaneously [126, 1219, 1220] in acertain “window.” The only exception is theJP = 0 ±channel. There are special reasons why0± mesons areexceptional, see [1221].

scale separation in the Wilsonian OPE. It was gener-ally believed that the coefficients are fully determinedby perturbation theory while non-perturbative effectsappear only in the OPE operators.54 This belief ledto inconsistencies which revealed themselves e.g. in theissue of renormalons (see below). A set of graphs rep-resented by renormalons is constructed from a singlegluon exchange by inserting any number of loops in thegluon line like beads in a necklace ([Ref. [1222]). Beingtreated formally this contribution, shown in Fig.5.8.3,diverges factorially at high orders. I vividly rememberthat after the first seminar on SVZ in 1978 Eugene Bo-gomol’nyi asked me each time we met: “Look, how canyou speak of power corrections in then-point functionsat largeQ2 if even the perturbative expansion (i.e. theexpansion in 1/log(Q2/Λ2)) is not well defined? Isn’tit inconsistent?” I must admit that at that time myanswer to Eugene was somewhat evasive.
The basic principle of Wilson’s OPE – the scale sep-aration principle – is “soft versus hard” rather than“perturbative versus non-perturbative.” Being definedin this way the condensates are explicitlyµdependent.
All physical quantities are certainlyµindependent; thenormalization point dependence of the condensates iscompensated by that of the coefficient functions – seeFig. 5.8.2.
The problem of renormalons disappears once we in-troduce the normalization pointµ. Withµ≫Λ, thereisnofactorialdivergenceinhighordersofperturbationstheory. Renormalons conspire with the gluon conden-sates to produce, taken together, a well-defined OPE.
The modern construction goes under the name of the“renormalon conspiracy”; it is explained in detail in myreview [1216]. I hasten to add, though, that the renor-malons acquirea life of their ownin those cases in whichOPE does not exist. Qualitatively, they can shed lighton scaling dimensions of non-perturbative effects. Themostclear-cutexampleofthistypeistheso-called“polemass of the heavy quarks” [1223, 1224] and its relationto a theoretically well-defined mass parameter [1225].
Insometwo-dimensionalsolvablemodelsexactOPEcan be constructed which explicitly demonstrates theµdependence of both the coefficient functions and thecondensates in the Wilsonian paradigm and its cancel-lation in the physical quantities (for a recent study seee.g. [1226]). Needless to say, if QCD was exactly solvedwe would have no need in the SVZ sum rules.
Wehadtosettleforareasonablecompromise,knownas the practical version of OPE . In the practical versionwecalculatethecoefficientfunctionsperturbativelykeep-ing a limited number of loop corrections. The conden-54 Unfortunately, this misconception lasted through the 1980sand was visible in the literature even in the 1990s and later.5.8 OPE-based sum rules 165sate series is truncated too. The condensates are notcalculated from first principles; rather a limited set isdetermined from independent data.
The practical version is useful in applications onlyprovided µ2 can be made small enough to ensure thatthe “perturbative” contributions to the condensates aremuch smaller than their genuine (mostly non-perturba-tive) values. At the same time,αs(µ2)/π must be smallenough for the expansion in the coefficients to makesense.Theexistenceofsuch “ µ2 window”isnotgranteda priori and is a very fortunate feature of QCD. We didobserve this feature empirically in almost all low-lyinghadrons [1227, 1228] 55. At the same time, we identi-fied certain exceptional channels revealing unforeseennuances in hadronic physics [1221].
5.8.6 Implementation of the idea and resultsAfter the strategic idea of quark and gluon interactionwith the vacuum medium became clear we delved intothe uncharted waters of microscopic hadronic physics.
Remember, in 1977 nobody could imagine that basichadronic parameters for at least some hadrons couldbe analytically calculated, at least approximately. As ashow-case example we chose the most typical mesons,ρand φ, to calculate their couplings to the electromag-netic current and masses. The agreement of our resultswith experiment was better than we coulda priori ex-pect.Atfirstwewerediscouragedbyawrongsignofthegluon condensate term in the theoretical part of the ap-propriate SVZ sum rule. We suddenly understood thatthis sign could be compensated by the four-quark con-densate – a real breakthrough. In November of 1977we published a short letter [1213] which still missed anumber of elements (e.g. Borelization) developed andincorporated later, one by one. We worked at a fever-ish pace for the entire academic year, accumulating alarge number of results for the hadronic parameters.
All low-lying meson resonances built from the u,d,squarks and gluons were studied and their static proper-ties determined from SVZ: masses, coupling constants,charge radii,ρ-ωmixing, and so on, with unprecedentedsuccess. In summer of 1978, inspired by our progress,we prepared a number of preprints (I think, eight ofthem simultaneously56) and submitted to ICHEP-78in Tokyo. Clearly none of us were allowed to travel toTokyo to present our results.
I cannot help mentioning an incident that occurredin the spring of 1978 when we were mostly done with55 Theoretical understanding of the roots of this phenomenonremains unclear. Seemingly, it has no known analogues in two-dimensional models.
56 In the journal publication they were combined in three arti-cles occupying the whole issue of Nucl. Phys. B147,No5, 1979.
this work. The episode may have been funny were itnot so nerve-wracking. When we decided that the cal-culational stage of the work was over, I collected allmy drafts (hundreds of sheets of paper with derivationsand math expressions), I organized them in proper or-der, selected all expressions we might have needed forthe final draft of the paper and the future work, metic-ulously rewrote them in a voluminous notebook (re-member, we had no access to photocopying machines),destroyed the original drafts, put the notebook in mybriefcase and went home. It was about midnight, and Iwas so exhausted that I fell asleep while on the metrotrain. A loud voice announcing my stop awoke me, andI jumped out of the train, leaving the briefcase were itwas, on the seat. By the time I realized what had hap-pened the train was gone, and gone with it forever mycalculations ... I have never recovered my briefcase withthe precious notebook... After a few agonizing days itbecame clear that the necessary formulas and expres-sions had to be recovered anew. Fortunately, Vainshteinand Zakharov had kept many of their own derivations.
Vainshtein never throws away anything as a matter ofprinciple. Therefore, the problem was to dig out “in-formative” sheets of paper from the “noise” (this washindered by the fact that Vainshtein was in Novosibirskwhile we were in Moscow). Part of my drafts survivedin the drawers of a huge desk that I had inherited fromV. Sudakov. Better still, many crucial calculations werediscussedsomanytimesbyus,overandoveragain,thatI remembered them by heart. Nevertheless, I think ittook a couple of uneasy weeks to reconstruct in full thecontents of the lost notebook.
The SVZ method was further developed by manyfollowers(e.g.theso-calledlight-conesumrulesforform-factors), see [1229] and [1230]. A broad picture of thehadronic world was obtained by the 1980s and later[1231]. Today the pioneering SVZ paper is cited 6000+times. Until 1990s, when lattice QCD based on numericcalculations, started approaching its maturity, the SVZmethod was the main tool for analyzing static hadronicproperties.
5.8.7 Reliability and predictive powerThe SVZ method is admittedly approximate. Yet, it isnot a model in the sense that it cannot be arbitrarilybent to accommodate “wrong” data. It is instructive tonarrate here the story of an alleged discovery of an al-leged “paracharmonium” referred to asX(2.83) in Jan-uary of 1977 [1232]. It was widely believed then thatX(2.83) was the0− ground sate of¯ccquarks, ηc. If thiswas the case the mass difference betweenJ/ψ and ηcwould be close to 270 MeV. Shortly after, the interpre-tation of X(2.83) as ηc was categorically ruled out by166 5 APPROXIMATE QCDthe SVZ analysis [1233] whichpredicted that the abovemass difference must be 100±30 MeV. Two years later,a new experiment [1234] negated the existence of theX(2.83) state. In the very same experiment the gen-uine paracharmonium was observed at2.98±0.01 GeV,in perfect agreement with [1233]. For us this was a tri-umph and a lesson – if one believes in a theory oneshould stand for it!5.8.8 OPE-based construction of heavy quark massexpansionIn the 1980s and early 1990s OPE was generalized tocover theoretical studies of mixed heavy-light hadrons,i.e. those built from light,q, and heavy,Q, flavors. Inthe 1990s those who used1/mQ expansion in theoret-ical analysis ofQ¯q and Qqq systems numbered in thehundreds. A large range of practical physics problem re-lated toQ¯q and Qqq systems were solved. Lattice anal-yses of such systems even now remain hindered, and inmany instances the1/mQ expansion remains the onlyreliable theoretical method.
As I have mentioned in the second paragraph of Sec.
5.8.2, heavy quarks in QCD introduce an extra scale,mQ. To qualify as a heavy quarkQ the correspond-ing mass term mQ must be much larger thanΛQCD.
The charmed quarkc can be considered as heavy onlywith some reservations whileband tare bona fide heavyquarks. The hadrons composed from one heavy quarkQ, a light antiquark¯q, or a “diquark”qq, plus a gluoncloud (which also contains light quark-antiquark pairs)– let us call themHQ – can be treated in the frameworkof OPE. The role of the cloud is, of course, to keep allthe above objects together, in a colorless bound state.
The light component ofHQ, its light cloud, has a com-plicated structure; the soft modes of the light fields arestrongly coupled and strongly fluctuate. Basically, theonly fact which we know for sure is that the light cloudis indeed light; typical excitation frequencies are of or-der ofΛ. One can try to visualize the light cloud as asoft medium.57 The heavy quarkQ is then submergedin this medium. The latter circumstance allows one todevelop a formalism similar to SVZ in which the softQCD vacuum medium is replaced by that of the lightcloud.Asaresult,anOPE-basedexpansioninpowersof1/mQ emerges (see Fig.5.8.4). When heavy quarks arein soft medium the heavy quark-antiquark pair creationdoes not occur and the field-theoretic description of theheavy quark becomes redundant. A large “mechanical”part in thex dependence of Q(x) can be a priori iso-57 Hard gluons do play a role too. They have to be taken intoaccount in the coefficient functions as will be mentioned In Sec.

lated, Q(x) = exp( −imQt) ˜Q(x). The reduced bispinorfield ˜Q(x) describes a residual heavy quark motion in-side the soft cloud; the heavy quark mass appears onlyin the form of powers of1/mQ (first noted in 1982).
Comprehensive reviews on the OPE-based heavyquark theory exist [1225], [1237],[1238], [674]. There thereader will find exhaustive lists of references to originalpublications. Therefore, in my presentation below I willbe brief, with a focus on a historical aspect, as I remem-ber it, and limit myself to a few selected references.
In the early 1980s abundant data on the meson andbaryonHQ states started to appear. Theoretical under-standing of the total decay rates beyond the free-quarkcalculations became a major goal. This challenge pavedthe way to the beginning of the1/mQ expansion inHQhadron physics in the mid 1980s. The decay rate intoan inclusive final statef can be written in terms of theimaginary part of a forward scattering operator (the so-called transition operator) evaluated to second order inthe weak interactions [1235, 1236],Im ˆT(Q→f→Q)=Im∫d4x iT(LW(x)L†W(0))(5.8.4)where T denotes the time ordered product and LWis the relevant weak Lagrangian at the normalizationpointµ∼mQ.Thefactor exp(−imQt) mentionedaboveis implicit in Eq. (5.8.4). Descending toµ ≪mQ one5.8 OPE-based sum rules 167arrives at the OPE expansionΓ(HQ →f) = G2F|VCKM|2m5Q×∑i˜c(f)i (µ)⟨HQ|Oi|HQ⟩µ2MHQ∝[c(f)3 (µ)⟨HQ|¯QQ|HQ⟩(µ)2MHQ+c(f)5 (µ)m−2Q⟨HQ|¯Qi2 σGQ|HQ⟩(µ)2MHQ+∑ic(f)6,i(µ)m−3Q⟨HQ|( ¯QΓiq)(¯qΓiQ)|HQ⟩(µ)2MHQ+O(1/m4Q) + ...
], (5.8.5)where Γi represent various combinations of the Diracγmatrices, see also Table5.8.1. In SVZ we dealt with thevacuum expectation values of relevant operators whilein the heavy quark physics the relevant operators aresandwiched betweenHQ states.
5.8.9 ApplicationsThe expansion (5.8.5) allowed us to obtain [1235, 1236]the first quantitative predictions for the hierarchies ofthe lifetimes of Q¯q mesons and Qqq baryons (Q waseither c or b quark) in the mid-1980s – another spec-tacular success of the OPE-based methods. The dra-matic story ofηc narrated in Sec.5.8.7 repeated itself.
With the advancement of experiment in the late 1990s,a drastic disagreement was allegedly detected in theratio τ(Λb)/τ(Bd)exp = 0 .77 ±0.05 compared to thetheoretical predictionτ(Λb)/τ(Bd)theor = 0.9 ±0.03(e.g. [1225]). In the 2010s theΛb lifetime was remea-sured shifting the above experimental ratio up to0.93±0.05. Hurrah!In the mid-1980s, at the time of the initial theoreti-cal studies of theHc and Hb lifetime hierarchies [1235,1236], next to nothing was known about heavy baryons.
Since then enormous efforts were invested in improv-ing theoretical accuracy both in mesons and baryonsin particular by including higher-dimension operatorsin the inverse heavy quark mass expansion and higher-order αs terms in the OPE coefficients. The status ofthe Inverse Heavy Quark Mass Expansion (IHQME)for HQ lifetimes as of 2014 was presented in the review[1239]. The advances reported there and in more recentyears cover more precise determination of the matrixelements of four-quark operators via HQET sum rules[1240], calculations of the higherαs corrections, in par-ticular,α3s corrections to the semileptonicbquark decay[1241], the first determination of the Darwin coefficientfor non-leptonic decays [1242, 1243], etc. Comparisonwith the current set of data on τ(Hc) can be foundin [1244]. In this context I should also mention an im-pressive publication [1245] (see also references therein)which, in addition to a comprehensive review of theOPE-based analysis of theHc lifetimes, acquaints thereader with a dramatic story of the singly charmedbaryon hierarchy. Indeed, according to PDG-2018 thelifetimeof Ω0c is69±12 fswhilePDG-2020yields τ(Ω0c) =268±24±10 fs! The jump in theΩ0c lifetime by a factorof 3 to 4 compared to the previous measurements wasreported by LHCb [1246–1248].58 With these new datathe observed hierarchy of lifetimes changes:Ω0c movesfrom the first place (the shortest livingHc baryon) tothe third. The question arises whether the OPE-basedtheory can explain the current experimental situationτ(Ξ0) < τ(Λ+c ) < τ(Ω0c) < τ(Ξ+). In [1245] it is ar-gued that the answer is “yes, it is possible” (see Fig. 5in [1245]) provided one takes into account1/m4c contri-butions due to four-quark operators andαs correctionsin the appropriate coefficient functions.59I should emphasize that the theoretical accuracy inthe Hc family is limited by the fact that the expan-sion parameter ΛQCD/mc is not small enough. Evenincluding sub-leading contributions will hardly provideus with high-precision theoretical predictions. ForHcstatesIHQME at bestprovidesus witha semi-quantita-tive guide. On the other hand, in the theory ofHb de-cays one expects much better precision.
5.8.10 Around 1990s and beyond(1) Heavy quark symmetry whenmQ → ∞The light-cloud interpretation as in Fig. 5.8.4 imme-diately implies that at zero recoil the (appropriatelynormalized) B →D formfactors reduce to unity. Thisis called the “small velocity (SV) limit theorem” [1250],[1251]. The above“unification” is similar to the vectorchargenon-renormalizationtheorematzeromomentumtransfer, say, for the¯uγµdcurrent. TheDandBmassesare very far from each other. One has to subtract themechanical part of the heavy quark mass in order tosee that all dynamical parameters are insensitive to thesubstitution Q1 ↔Q2 in the limitmQ1,2 →∞, with58 Of course, this could happen only because (presumably)statistical and/or systematic errors in the previous measure-ments were grossly underestimated. It is also curious to notethat 30 years ago Blok and I argued [1249] (Secs. 4.2 and 6)that Ω0c could be the longest living singly charmed baryon dueto itsssspin-1 diquark structure.
59 The four-quark operators introduced in [1235,1236] respon-sible for the Pauli interference yield correctionsO(1/m3c), seeEq. (5.8.5). The authors of [1245] go beyond this set.168 5 APPROXIMATE QCDthe SV limit ensuing at zero recoil. Perhaps, this is thereason why it was discovered so late. The next step wasmade by Isgur and Wise who generalized this symme-try of the zero-recoil point by virtue of the Isgur-Wisefunction [1252, 1253].
(2) HQETHeavyquarkeffectivetheorywhichemergedinthe1990s[667, 1254] formalizes and automates a number of as-pects of the generic1/mQ expansion. In fact, it imme-diately follows from the construction similar to (5.8.5).
Simplified rules of behavior proved to be very helpfulfor QCD practitioners in the subsequent developmentof various applications. In HQET the reduced field˜Qistreated quantum-mechanically, its non-relativistic na-ture is built in, and the normalization pointµis ≪mQfrom the very beginning.60 Applying the Dirac equationto eliminate small (lower) components in favor of thelarge components it is easy to derive the expansion ofL0heavy, up to terms1/m2Q,L0heavy = ¯Q(i̸D−mQ)Q= ¯Q1 + γ02(1 + (σπ)28m2Q)[π0 − 12mQ(πσ)2 −− 18m2Q(−( ⃗D⃗E) + 2 σ ·⃗E×π)]×(1 + (σπ)28m2Q)1 + γ02 Q+ O(1m3Q), (5.8.6)where σ denote the Pauli matrices and(πσ)2 = π2 + σ ⃗B,⃗E and ⃗B denote the background chromoelectric andchromomagnetic fields, respectively. Moreover, the op-erator πµ is defined throughiDµQ(x) = e−imQvµxµ (mQvµ + iDµ) ˜Q(x)≡e−imQvµxµ (mQvµ + πµ) ˜Q(x) (5.8.7)where vµ is the heavy quark four-velocity. The set ofoperators presented in (5.8.6) plays the same basic rolein 1/mQ expansion as the set in Table5.8.1 in SVZ sumrules.
IntheremainderofthissectionIwillbrieflymentionsome classic problems with heavy quarks which weresuccessfully solved in the given paradigm.
(3) CGG/BUV theorem60 I personally prefer to consider the heavy quark expansionsdirectly infull QCD in the framework of the Wilson OPE by-passing the intermediate stage of HQET.
Up to order1/m2Q all inclusive decay widths of theHQmesons coincide with the parton model results for theQ decay [1255], [1256],Γ = Γ0(1 − µ2π2m2Q), µ 2π = 12MHQ⟨HQ|¯Q⃗ π2Q|HQ⟩(5.8.8)where Γ0 is the parton model result. There are no cor-rections O(1/mQ). This is known as the CGG/BUVtheorem.
(4) Spectra and line shapesLepton spectra in semileptonicHQ decays were derivedin [1257]. The leading corrections arising at the1/mQlevel were completely expressed in terms of the differ-ence in the mass ofHQ and Q. Nontrivial effects ap-pearing at the order1/m2Q were shown to affect mainlythe endpoint region; they are different for meson andbaryon decays as well as for beauty and charm decays.
The theory of the line shape in HQ decays, suchas B →Xsγ where Xs denotes the inclusive hadronicstate with thesquark, resembles that of the Mössbauereffect.Itisabsolutelyremarkablethatfor10yearstherewere no attempts to treat the spectra and line shapesalong essentially the same lines as it had been done indeep inelastic scattering (DIS) in the 1970s. Realizationof this fact came only in 1994; technical implementationof the idea was carried out in [1258], [1259], and [1260].

(6) In conclusionConcluding the heavy quark portion I should add thatKolya Uraltsev (1957-2013), one of the major contribu-tors in heavy quark theory died in 2013 at the peak ofhis creative abilities (see [1222]).
Concerning the OPE-based methods in QCD in gen-eral, I would like to make an apology to the many au-thors whose works have not been directly cited. Thesize limitations are severe. The appropriate referencesare given in the review papers listed in the text above.
Just for the record, a couple of reviews which aretangentiallyconnectedtothetopicofthepresentarticleare given in Refs. [1263] and [1264].5.9 Factorization and spin asymmetries 1695.8.11 Recent developments unrelated to the OPE-based methodsQuantum field theories from the same class as QCDare now experiencing dramatic changes and rapid ad-vances in a deeper understanding of anomalies. I wantto mention two crucial papers: [1265] and [1266]. Thelatter demonstrates that atθ = π there is a discrete ’tHooft anomaly involving time reversal and the centersymmetry. It follows that atθ = π the vacuum cannotbe a trivial non-degenerate gapped state.
5.9 Factorization and spin asymmetriesJianwei Qiu5.9.1 QCD F actorizationHadrons,suchasthe proton, neutronand pion,are rela-tivistic bound states of strongly interacting quarks andgluons of QCD. Without being able to see any quark orgluon directly in isolation, owing to the color confine-ment of QCD, it has been an unprecedented intellectualchallenge to explore and quantify internal structure ofhadrons in terms of their constituents, quarks and glu-ons, and the emergence of hadrons from quarks or glu-ons. Actually, the QCD color interaction is so strongat a typical hadronic scaleO(1/R) with a hadron ra-dius R ∼1 fm that any scattering cross section withidentified hadron(s) cannot be calculated fully in QCDperturbation theory.
QCD factorization [224] has been developed to de-scribe high energy hadronic scattering with a large mo-mentum transferQ ≫1/R ∼ΛQCD by taking the ad-vantageoftheasymptoticfreedomofQCDbywhichthecolor interaction becomes weaker and calculable pertur-batively at short distances. QCD factorization providesa controllable and consistent way toapproximate QCDcontributions togood or factorizable hadronic cross sec-tions by demonstrating– allprocess-dependentnonperturbativecontributionsto thesegood cross sections are suppressed by pow-ers ofΛQCD/Q, which could be neglected if the hardscale Q is sufficiently large,– allfactorizablenonperturbativecontributionsarepro-cess independent, representing the characteristics ofidentified hadron(s), and– the process dependence of factorizable contributionsis perturbatively calculable from partonic scatteringat the short-distance.
Withourabilitytocalculatetheprocess-dependentshortdistance partonic scatterings perturbatively at the hardscale Q, the prediction of QCD factorization followswhen cross sections with different hard scatterings butthe same nonperturbative long-distance effect of identi-fied hadron are compared. QCD Factorization also sup-plies physical content to these perturbatively uncalcu-lable, but universal long-distance effects of identifiedhadrons by matching them to hadronic matrix elementsof active quark and/or gluon operators, which could beinterpreted as parton distribution or correlation func-tions of the identified hadrons, and allows them to bemeasured experimentally or by numerical simulation.170 5 APPROXIMATE QCDXe(l)h(p)e(l')qJ(k,p)kqe(l')h(p)e(l)qe(l')kh(p)e(l)(a) (b)Fig.5.9.1 (a)SketchforscatteringamplitudeofinclusiveDIS.
(b) Leading order contribution to inclusive DIS cross section inits cut diagram notation.
Inclusive scattering with one identified hadronThe deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) between a lep-ton e of momentum l and a hadron h of momentump, e(l) + h(p) →e(l′) + X, as shown in Fig.5.9.1(a)where l′ is scattered lepton momentum andX repre-sents all possible final states, is an inclusive scatter-ing with one identified hadron. With a large momen-tum transfer,q = l−l′ and Q ≡√−q2 ≫ΛQCD, theDIS experiment at SLAC in 1969 discovered the point-like spin-1/2 partons/quarks inside a proton [93], whichhelped the discovery and formulation of QCD.
ForinclusiveDISwithtwocharacteristicscales: Q≫ΛQCD, QCD factorization is to consistently separateQCD dynamics taking place at these two distinctivescales by examining scattering amplitudes in terms ofgeneral properties of Feynman diagrams in QCD per-turbation theory, leading to a factorization formalism,which is an approximation up to corrections suppressedin powers of ΛQCD/Q. For example, considering theleading order (LO) contribution to the inclusive DIS, aspresented in Fig.5.9.1(b) in its cut diagram notation,in which graphical contributions to the cross sectionsare represented by the scattering amplitude to the leftof the final state cut (the red thin line) and the com-plex conjugate amplitude to the right, the scatteringbetween the lepton of momentuml and a quark (or aparton) of momentumk, ˆσLO(Q,k), is taken place atthe hard scale Q, while the dynamics describing thequark inside the hadron, J(k,p), is at the hadronicscale 1/R ∼ΛQCD. The validity of such perturbativeQCD factorization requires the suppression of quan-tum interference between the dynamics taking place atthese two different momentum scales, which requiresthat the dominant contributions to the factorized for-malism should necessarily come from the phase spacewhere the active parton(s) linking the dynamics at twodifferent scales are forced onto their mass shells, andare consequently long-lived compared to the time scaleof the hard collision at the scaleQ.

(5.9.1) with all perturba-tively pinched poles absorbed into the nonperturbativefunction of the identified hadron.
However, beyond the LO inclusive DIS, all inter-nal loop momentum integrals to any scattering am-plitude are defined by contours in complex momen-tum space, and it is only at momentum configurationswhere some subset of loop momenta are pinched thatthe contours are forced to or near mass-shell poles thatcorrespond to long-distance behavior. The importanceof such pinched surfaces in multidimensional momen-tum space was identified in the Libby-Sterman analy-sis [1267, 1268] that categorized all loop momenta intothree groups: hard, collinear, and soft, along with thereduced diagramsby contracting off-shell lines to points,from which factorization formalisms can be derived. Asshown in Fig.5.9.2(a) for inclusive DIS, the identifiedhadron is associated with a group of collinear partonlines, and at the leading power, one physically polarizedcollinear parton plus infinite longitudinally polarizedcollinear gluons (curly lines) link the identified hadronto the hard part,H, in which all parton lines are off-shell by the hard scaleQ. At the same time, the softgluon lines (dashed lines in Fig. 5.9.2(a)) can attach5.9 Factorization and spin asymmetries 171to both the hard and collinear lines of the identifiedhadron. Since all parton propagators inH are off-shellbyQ, a soft gluon attachment to any of these lines inHis necessarily to increase the number of off-shell propa-gators inH, and effectively suppresses the hard part byan inverse power ofQ, making the contribution powersuppressed. Therefore, we do not need to consider softcontributions to the inclusive DIS cross section at theleading power in1/Q expansion.
The collinear and longitudinally polarized gluonshave their polarization vectors proportional to theirmomenta in a covariant gauge. By applying the WardIdentity, all attachments of collinear and longitudinallypolarized gluons to the hard partH can be detachedand reconnected to the gauge link pointing to the “−”light-cone direction if the identified hadron is movingin the “+” light-cone direction [224, 1269], as sketchedin Fig.5.9.2(b). After taking the leading power contri-bution from the spinor trace of the active quark line inFig. 5.9.2(b) [1269, 1270], the inclusive DIS cross sec-tion at the leading power can be factorized as [1271–1273]E′ dσDISeh→eXd3l′ (l,p; l′) =∑f=q,¯q,g∫dx φf/h(x,µ2) (5.9.2)×E′ dˆσef→eXd3l′ (l,ˆk; l′,µ2) + O[Λ2QCDQ2]where ˆk≡xp+, l′T ∼Q≫ΛQCD, andE′dˆσef→eX/d3l′is the short-distance part of DIS cross section on a par-ton state of flavorf and collinear momentum fractionxof the colliding hadron, with its long-distance contribu-tions to the cross section systematically absorbed intothe non-perturbative functions φf/h(x,µ2), which aredefined in terms of hadronic matrix elements of activeparton operators [1274]. For example, for an unpolar-ized active quark,φq/h(x,µ2) =∫ dξ−2π eixp+ξ−×⟨h(p)|ψq(0)γ+2 W[0,ξ−]ψq(ξ−)|h(p)⟩, (5.9.3)whereW[0,ξ−] = Pexp[ig∫ξ−0 dη−A+(η−)]isthegaugelink. Theφf/h(x,µ2) carries nonperturbative informa-tion of the identified hadron, and is referred as an uni-versal parton distribution function (PDF) for finding aparton of flavorf inside a colliding hadronh, carryingits momentum fractionx, probed at a hard factoriza-tion scaleµ∼Q. PDFs are discussed in more detail inSec. 10.2.
With the precise definition ofφf/h(x,µ2), the QCDfactorization formalism, such as the one in Eq. (5.9.2),providesasystematicwaytocalculatetheshort-distancepartonicscattering, E′dˆσef→eX/d3l′,inQCDperturba-tion theory. By applying the factorization formalism inEq. (5.9.2) to a parton state of flavorf,|h(p)⟩→| f(p)⟩,we can use perturbation theory to calculate the shortdistance partonic scattering order-by-order in powers ofthe strong coupling constantαs by perturbatively cal-culating the DIS cross section on a parton of flavorfon the left of Eq. (5.9.2), and PDFs of the same partonon the right, with the collinear divergence regularized.

QCD factorization ensures that the collinear sen-sitivities from scattering off a parton on the left ofEq.

The inclusive DIS cross section can be physicallymeasuredinexperimentsandshouldnotdependonhowwe describe it in terms of QCD factorization, or thechoice of factorization scaleµ. That is, we requiredσeh→eX/dlog µ2 = 0,which implies evolution equations of PDFs, known asthe DGLAP equations [211, 215]dφf/h(x,µ2)dlog µ2 =∑f′∫ 1xdx′x′ Pf/f′(xx′ ,αs(µ2))×φf′/h(x′,µ2) (5.9.5)where the evolution kernelsPf/f′(x/x′,αs(µ2)) are cal-culable in perturbative QCD when the strong couplingconstantαs(µ) is sufficiently small [216, 217]. AlthoughPDFs are nonperturbative, their factorization scale de-pendence is a QCD prediction, which has been con-firmed to great accuracy [626, 627].

for the factorization. For the leading power contribu-tion beyond the LO in Fig.5.9.3(b), similar to inclu-sive DIS, we do not need to worry about soft interactionbetween the hard part and the collinear partons alongthe direction of the produced hadron. By applying theWard Identity, in the same way as in the factorizationof inclusive DIS, the attachment of collinear and lon-gitudinally polarized gluons from the observed hadronto the hard part,H, can be detached and reconnectedto the gauge link to become a part of the nonpertur-bative, but universal, fragmentation functions (FFs) ofthe identified hadron, leading to the factorization for-malism,Epdσe+e−→hXd3p (s,p) =∑f∫ dzz2 Dh/f(z,µ2) (5.9.6)×Ekdˆσe+e−→ˆkXd3ˆk(s,ˆk,µ2) + O[Λ2QCDQ2]where active parton momentum isˆk= p/z,√s=√(l+ l′)2is the collision energy, and Dh/f(z,µ2) is the FF tofind a hadronhemerged from a produced parton of fla-vor f while carrying the parton’s momentum fractionz [1274]. The fact that such a physical cross sectionshould not depend on how we factorized it implies evo-lution equations for the FFs, like DGLAP for PDFs.
From the QCD factorization formalisms involvingone identified hadron in Eqs. (5.9.2) and (5.9.6), ex-tracting the universal PDFs and FFs from experimen-tal data is a challenging inverse problem. Although thescale dependence of PDFs and FFs is a prediction ofQCD dynamics, measurements of such cross sectionswithoneidentifiedhadronarenotsufficienttodisentan-gle the flavor and momentum fraction dependence of allPDFs and FFs, which are necessary for the predictivepower of the QCD factorization approach to describehigh energy hadronic cross sections.
Inclusive scattering with two identified hadronsThe Drell-Yan (DY) production of lepton pairs via avectorbosoninhadron-hadroncollisions, A(p)+B(p′) →V(q) + X with V(q)[= γ∗,W/Z,H 0,...] → l + l′, assketched in Fig. 5.9.4(a), is an ideal example of thestudy of QCD factorization for inclusive observableswith two identified hadrons [224].
From the LO contribution in Fig.5.9.4(b), both ac-tive partons (quark or antiquark) of momentumk andk′ coming from colliding hadronsA(p) and B(p′), re-spectively, are perturbatively pinched to their mass-shell, which is necessary for being able to factorize thenonperturbativehadronicinformationofcollidinghadronsfrom the hard collision to produce the massive leptonpairs. Beyond the LO, each colliding hadron is associ-ated with a group of collinear partons, and for the lead-ing power contribution, only one physically polarizedactive parton plus infinite collinear and longitudinallypolarized gluons from each hadron should attach tothe hard part,H, with the remaining collinear partonsforming a (spectator) jet function, which is the same asthe inclusive scattering with one identified hadron. Thekey difference for QCD factorization of inclusive scat-tering with two identified hadrons from that with onehadron, according to the Libby-Sterman analysis [1267,1268], is the soft interaction between the collinear par-tons of two different hadrons, as shown by the dashedlines in Fig.5.9.5(a). Still the soft interaction betweenthe collinear partons and the hard part can be ne-glected when calculating the leading power contribu-tions. However, these long-distance soft interactions be-tween hadrons have the potential to break the univer-sality of the factorizable nonperturbative contributionfrom each identified hadron, and invalidate the predic-tivepoweroftheQCDfactorizationapproachforstudy-ing hadronic cross sections with identified hadrons.
Whenthecollidinghadrons A(p) andB(p′) aremov-ing in the+zand −zdirection, respectively, the factor-ization of collinear and longitudinally polarized gluonsfrom the hard partH is effectively the same as whatwas done for the case of single identified hadron. Sincecollinear and longitudinally polarized gluons have theirpolarization vectors proportional to their momenta ina covariant gauge, by applying the Ward Identity allcollinearandlongitudinallypolarizedgluonsfromhadronA(p) can be detached from the hard part and recon-nected to the gauge link in the “−” light-cone direc-A(p)B(p')l'lXqql'lB(p')A(p)kJ(k',p')J(k,p)k' k'k(a) (b)Fig. 5.9.4 (a) Sketch for scattering amplitude of Drell-Yanproduction of a massive lepton pair.

tion, while those from hadronB(p′) can be reconnectedto the gauge link in the “+” light-cone direction, assketched in Fig.5.9.5(b).
In order to achieve the factorization, we need to getrid of the soft gluon interactions, the dashed lines inFig. 5.9.5(b). If we scale collinear parton momenta fromcolliding hadron A, ki = ( k+i ,k−i ,kTi ) ∼ (1,λ2,λ)Qwith λ∼O(ΛQCD/Q), we maintaink2i ∼O(λ2Q2) →0as the loop momenta approach to the pinch surface. Ifwe can choose soft gluon loop momenta to have thescaling behavior, ls ∼ (λs,λs,λs)Q, where λs ∼ λ2(or λ) to have all components vanishing at the samerate, we have(ki+ ls)2 ∼2k+i l−s ∼O(λ2/Q2). That is,we only need to keep the “−” component of soft gluonmomenta to flow into the jet of collinear partons fromthe colliding hadron A, whose leading components ofLorentz indices that interact with the soft gluons arein the “+” direction in a covariant gauge. Therefore,we can use the Ward Identity to detach the soft gluonsfrom the jet of collinear partons from colliding hadronA and reconnect them into a gauge link or an eikonalline. Applying the same reasoning with the role of the“±” components switched, we can detach all soft gluoninteractions to the jet of collinear partons from collid-inghadron B,andtofactorizeallsoftgluoninteractionswith two colliding hadrons into an overall soft factor,as shown in Fig.5.9.6.
However, this factorization can fail if the soft gluonmomenta are trapped in the Glauber region. In this re-gion the “±” components of the soft gluons are smallQk'J(k,p)H(Q)A(p)lJ(k',p')kB(p')l'×SFig. 5.9.6 Sketch for factorized Drell-Yan production of amassive lepton pair at the leading power with all soft gluoninteractions factorized into a multiplicative soft factor.
compared to their transverse components,i.e. l±s /lTs ∼O(λ), so that we cannot neglect the transverse compo-nents, keeping only one “+” or “−” components [224].
It is the soft gluon interaction between the spectators oftwo colliding hadrons that can trap the±componentsof the soft gluon momenta in the Glauber region. Forexample, in Fig.5.9.7, the pair of propagators of mo-menta, p−k−l and k+ l, pinches the “−” componentof lto be,l− ∝l2T, while the pair of propagators of mo-menta,p′ −k′ +land k′ −l, pinches the “+” componentof l to be,l+ ∝l2T, such that the soft gluon interactionbetween two jets of collinear partons from the collidinghadrons is pinched in the Glauber region; in this casethe leading soft gluon interactions could break the uni-versality of PDFs and the predictive power of the QCDfactorization approach.
Removal of the trapped Glauber gluons might bethe most difficult part of the QCD factorization proof[224]. It was achieved by three key steps: (1) all poles inone-half plane cancel after summing over all final-states(nomorepinchedpoles),(2)all l±s -typeintegrationscanbe deformed out of the trapped soft region, and (3) allleading power spectator interactions can be factorizedand summed into an overall unitary soft factor of gaugelinks (or eikonal lines) as argued above and shown inFig. 5.9.6. The soft factor is process independent andmade of four gauge links, along the light-cone directionsconjugated to the directions of two incoming hadronsin the scattering amplitude, and the two in the com-plex conjugate scattering amplitude, respectively. Forthe collinear factorization, the soft factor = 1 due tothe unitarity, and we have the corresponding factoriza-tion formalism for inclusive Drell-Yan production at theleading power,dσ(DY)A+B→ll′+XdQ2dy =∑ff′∫dxdx′ φf/A(x,µ) φf′/B(x′,µ)× dˆσf+f′→ll′+X(x,x′,µ,α s)dQ2dy + O[Λ2QCDQ2], (5.9.7)where ∑ff′ runs over all parton flavors including quarkand antiquark, as well as gluon.

From the LO contribution in Fig.5.9.8(b),both active partons of momentumk and k′ are pertur-batively pinched to their mass-shell, leading to a po-tential factorization of PDF from colliding hadron andFF of the fragmenting parton to the observed hadron.
Beyond the LO, like the Drell-Yan process, there couldbe soft interactions between the jet of collinear partonsof the hadronh and the jet of collinear partons alongthe direction of observed hadronh′.
Integrating over the transverse momentum of theobserved final-state hadron to keep the SIDIS as a pro-cess with a single hard scaleQ, and following the samefactorizationargumentsforinclusiveDrell-Yanprocesses,the SIDIS cross section can be factorized asE′ dσSIDISeh→eh′Xd3l′dz (l,p; l′,z)=∑f,f′=q,¯q,g∫dz′ dx Dh′/f′(z′,µ2) φf/h(x,µ2)×E′ dˆσef→ef′Xd3l′dz′ (l,ˆk; l′,z′,µ2) + O[Λ2QCDQ2](5.9.8)where ˆk= xp, z′ = p′/k′ and z= p·p′/p·q.

Inclusive scattering with three identified hadronsInclusive single hadron production at large transversemomentum pT in hadronic collisions:A(p) + B(p′) →h(ph)+ X is a well-measured observable involving threeidentified hadrons, as shown in Fig.5.9.9. Due to theadditional identified hadron in the final-state, the uni-tarity sum of final-state hadrons used to prove the fac-torization of DY-type two-hadron observables needs tobe modified.
Luckily, because of the large pT of the observedfinal-state hadron, the potentially dangerous gluon in-teractions between the observed hadron and the specta-tors of colliding hadrons are suppressed by the power of1/pT, and the leading power pQCD factorization does5.9 Factorization and spin asymmetries 175hold [1277],dσAB→hX(p,p,p h)dydp2T=∑f,f′,c∫ dzz2 dxdx′ Dh/c(z,µ2)×φf/A(x,µ2) φf′/B(x′,µ2)× dˆσff′→cX(x,x′,pc = ph/z)dycdp2cT.(5.9.10)With proper PDFs and FFs, the NLO pQCD calcu-lations for single hadron production gave an excellentdescription of RHIC data [1278]. However, the sameformalism consistently underestimates the productionrate at the fixed target energies [1279]. It was shownthat high order corrections at the fixed target energiesare very important, and the threshold resummation sig-nificantly improves the comparison between the theoryand experimental data [1280].
QCD global analysis and predictive powerMuch of the predictive power of QCD factorization forcross sections involving identified hadron(s) relies onthe universality of the PDFs and/or FFs and our abilityto solve the inverse problem to demonstrate the exis-tence of one set of PDFs and FFs that are capable ofdescribing all data ofgood (e.g. factorizable) cross sec-tions with properly calculated short-distance partonicscattering cross sections in QCD perturbation theory.
The QCD global analysis is a program to test theconsistency of QCD factorization by fitting all exist-ing data from high energy scatterings with universalPDFs and/or FFs and corresponding factorization for-malisms, from which the best set of PDFs and/or FFswill be extracted. The QCD factorization formalism hasbeen extremely successful in interpreting high energyexperimental data from all facilities around the world,covering many orders in kinematic reach in both par-ton momentum fractionx and momentum transfer ofthe hard collisionQ, and as large as 15 orders of mag-nitude in difference in the size of observed scatteringcross sections, which is a great success story of QCDand the Standard Model at high energy. It has givenus the confidence and the tools to discover the Higgsparticle in proton-proton collisions [120, 121], and tosearch for new physics [1281].
QCD factorization for two-scale observablesThe hard probe with a single large momentum transferQ(≫1/R) is so localized in space that it is not verysensitive to the details of confined three-dimensional(3D) internal structure of the colliding hadron, in whicha confined parton should have a characteristic trans-verse momentum scale⟨kT⟩∼ 1/R ≪Q and an un-certainty in transverse position⟨bT⟩∼ R ≫1/Q. Re-cently, new and more precise data are becoming avail-able for two-scale observables with a hard scaleQ tolocalize the collision to probe the partonic nature ofquarks and gluons along with a soft scale to be sensi-tive to the dynamics taking place atO(1/R). At thesame time, theory has made major progresses in thedevelopment of QCD factorization formalism for twotypesoftwo-scaleobservables,distinguishedbytheirin-clusive or exclusive nature, which enables quantitativematching between the measurements of such two-scaleobservables and the 3D internal partonic structure of acolliding hadron.
For inclusive two-scale observables, one well-studiedexample is the Drell-Yan production of a massive bosonthat decays into a pair of measured leptons in hadron-hadron collisions as a function of the pair’s invariantmass Qand transverse momentumqT in the Lab frame[1282]. WhenQ≫qT ≳ 1/R, the measured transversemomentum of the pair is sensitive to the transverse mo-menta of the two colliding partons before they annihi-late into the massive boson, providing the opportunityto extract the information on the active parton’s trans-verse motion at the hard collision, which is encodedin transverse momentum dependent (TMD) PDFs (orsimply, TMDs),φf/h(x,kT,µ2) [1282].
Like PDFs, TMDs are universal distribution func-tions describing how a quark (or gluon) with a mo-mentum fraction x and transverse momentum kT in-teracts with a colliding hadron of momentump withxp ∼µ ∼Q ≫kT. Another well-studied example isthe SIDIS when the produced hadron is almost back-to-back to the scattered lepton in the Lab frame, or inthe Breit frame, the transverse momentum of the pro-duced hadronphT is much smaller than the hard scaleQ [1283, 1284].
A necessary condition for QCD factorization of ob-servables with identified hadron(s) is that the activepartonlinkingtheprocess-dependentshort-distancedy-namics and the process-independent nonperturbativephysics of identified hadron(s) is perturbatively pinchedto its mass-shell so that it is long-lived compared to thetime scale of the hard collision. In this case the quan-tum interference between the perturbatively calculablehard collisions at the hard scale Q and the process-independent part of leading nonperturbative informa-tion of the identified hadron(s) is strongly suppressedby the power ofΛQCD/Q. The pinch does not requirethe active parton’s momentum to be collinear to thehadron momentum. The necessary condition is satis-fied if the active parton momentum has a transversecomponent with ⟨kT⟩ ≪Q; the same condition thatshould be satisfied by the TMD factorization of Drell-Yan and SIDIS process for the leading power contri-bution in qT/Q or phT/Q, respectively. Although this176 5 APPROXIMATE QCDcondition is not necessarily sufficient, the TMD factor-ization for Drell-Yan process at the leading power ofqT/Q→0 was justified [1269, 1282], and the same forthe SIDIS at leading power ofphT/Q[1285–1287]. Morediscussion on the impact of TMD factorization for thespin asymmetries will be given in Sec.5.9.2.
Without breaking the colliding hadron, the exclu-sive observables could provide different aspects of thehadron’s internal structure. Exclusive lepton-nucleonscattering with a virtual photon of invariant massQ≫1/R could provide various two-scale observables, suchasthedeeplyvirtualComptonscattering(DVCS)[ 1288],where the hard scale is Q and the soft scale is t ≡(p−p′)2. When Q ≫√|t|, such two-scale exclusiveprocesses are dominated by the exchange of an activeq¯q or gg pair and can be systematically treated usingthe QCD factorization approach; factorized in termsof generalized PDFs or GPDs [1289–1292]. Recently, anew class ofsingle diffractive hard exclusive processes(SDHEP) was introduced [1293, 1294]. This approachis not only sufficiently generic to cover all known pro-cesses for extracting GPDs, but also well-motivated forthe search of new processes for the study of GPDs. Itwas demonstrated that many of those new processescan be factorized in terms of GPDs and could providebetter sensitivity to the parton momentum fractionxdependence of GPDs.
5.9.2 Spin AsymmetriesA measured cross section is always a positive and clas-sical probability even though its underlying dynamicscould be sensitive to quantum effects. On the otherhand, a spin asymmetry, defined to be proportional to adifference of two cross sections with one (or more) spinvector(s) flipped, can probe QCD dynamics that a spin-averaged cross section is not sensitive to, and provide abetter chance to explore the dynamics of quantum ef-fects.Italsoprovidesopportunitiestoexploretheoriginof proton spin by carrying out scattering experimentswith polarized protons.
Quark and gluon contributions to proton spinThe leading power collinear factorization formalismscan also apply to asymmetries of cross sections betweentwo longitudinally polarized particles [1269]. Instead ofmeasuring nonperturbative PDFs of a hadron, the dou-ble longitudinal spin asymmetryALL ≡∆σσ = σ(++) −σ(+,−)σ(+,+) + σ(+,−), (5.9.11)where ±indicates the helicity of the active parton com-pared to the longitudinal spin direction of the collidingparticle, is sensitive to the active parton’s helicity dis-tribution inside a polarized colliding hadron. The dou-ble longitudinal spin-dependent cross sections, ∆σ isgiven by the same factorization formalisms introducedin the Sec.5.9.1 with the spin-averaged collinear PDFsreplaced by corresponding helicity distributions,φf/h(x,µ2) →∆φf/h(x,µ2)= 12[φ+/+(x,µ2) −φ−/+(x,µ2)].
The same leading power collinear factorization for-malisms introduced in the Sec.5.9.1 can also apply toparity violating single longitudinal spin asymmetries ofcross sections between one unpolarized and one longi-tudinally polarized particles,AL ≡σ(+) −σ(−)σ(+) + σ(−). (5.9.12)The single longitudinal spin-dependent cross section,∆σ = σ(+) −σ(−) with spin direction of the polar-ized parton flipped is also given by the same factoriza-tion formalisms by replacing one of the spin-averagedcollinear PDFs, corresponding to the hadron that is re-placed by a polarized colliding particle, by correspond-ing helicity distribution. With the flavor sensitivities ofthe weak interaction, the single longitudinal spin asym-metries measured by the RHIC spin program have pro-vided important information on the flavor separation ofquark helicity distributions [820, 1278].
The double and single longitudinal spin asymme-tries, defined in Eqs. (5.9.11) and (5.9.12), respectively,have been studied in both hadron-hadron collisions atRHIC [1278] and lepton-hadron collisions [1295, 1296],and will be a major program at the future EIC [820].
After over 30 years since the discovery of EMC col-laboration, and many experiments carried out world-wide, the RHIC spin program in particular, we learnedfrom the momentum fractionsxthat these experimentscould access, that the proton spin gets about 30% fromquark helicity and 40% from gluon helicity, and the restcould come from the region ofxthat we have not beenable to explore and/or orbital or transverse motion ofquarks and gluons inside the bound proton [820]. (Seethe discussion in Sec.10.2.)Double transverse-spin asymmetriesThe double transverse spin asymmetries are,ANN = σ(↑,↑) −σ(↑,↓)σ(↑,↑) + σ(↑,↓),where ↑and ↓indicate the direction of spin vectorstransverse to the momentum direction of the colliding5.9 Factorization and spin asymmetries 177particles. Since QCD factorization requires that the fac-torized short-distance dynamics is not sensitive to thedetails of hadronic physics, the spin asymmetries areproportional to the difference of hadronic matrix ele-ments of parton fields with the hadron spin flipped,A∝σ(Q,⃗ s) −σ(Q,−⃗ s)∝⟨p,⃗ s|O(ψq,Aµg)|p,⃗ s⟩−⟨p,−⃗ s|O(ψq,Aµg)|p,−⃗ s⟩.

Thoseoperators that lead to a “+” sign should contributeto spin-averaged cross sections, while those lead to a“−” sign should contribute to spin asymmetries. Onlythe leading twist quark operator that defines the quarktransversity distributionδq(x,µ2)δq(x,µ2) = ψq(0)γ+γ⊥γ5ψq(ξ−),(or h1(x,µ2)), is relevant to the double transverse spinasymmetries of observables with a single large momen-tum transfer Q in proton-proton collisions of trans-versely polarized protons.
The QCD factorization for the leading power con-tribution to the Drell-Yan production of a massive lep-ton pair in a collision with two transversely polarizedprotons should follow the same arguments that led tothat in Fig.5.9.6. Here all collinear and longitudinallypolarized gluons factorized into gauge links, and softgluon interactions are factorized into an overall soft-factor. The factorization of spinor traces of the Fermionlines needs to be modified to reflect the transverse-spinprojector γ±γ⊥γ5 (where ±indicates the two possi-bilities due to two colliding hadrons) instead of theγ± and γ±γ5 for unpolarized and longitudinally po-larized active quarks. Therefore, the QCD factorizationformalism for the numerator of the double transverse-spin asymmetries is the same as that in Eq. (5.9.7),except the unpolarized PDFs are replaced by the quarktransversity distributions of various flavors (no gluontransversity distribution in a spin-1/2 transversely po-larized proton), and the hard part is calculated withγ±γ⊥γ5 spinprojectionfortransverselypolarizedquarks.
Thecollineartransversitydistributionhasthesamedef-inition as the quark distribution in Eq. (5.9.3) with thequarkoperatorreplacedby ψq(0)γ+γ⊥γ5 W[0,ξ−]ψq(ξ−)/2and the unpolarized hadron state|h(p)⟩is replaced bya transversely polarized hadron state|h(p),⃗ s⊥⟩.
Single transverse-spin asymmetriesThe transverse single-spin asymmetry (SSA),AN ≡σ(sT) −σ(−sT)σ(sT) + σ(−sT),is defined as the ratio of the difference and the sum ofthe cross sections when the spin of one of the identifiedhadron sT is flipped. Two complementary QCD-basedapproaches have been proposed to analyze the physicsbehind the measured SSAs: (1) the TMD factorizationapproach [1283, 1284, 1297–1300], and (2) the collinearfactorization approach [1301–1309].
In the TMD factorization approach, the asymmetrywas attributed to the spin and transverse momentumcorrelation between the identified hadron and the ac-tive parton, and represented by the TMD parton dis-tribution or fragmentation function. For example, theSivers effect [1283] describes how hadron spin influ-ences the parton’s transverse motion inside a trans-versely polarized hadron, while the Collins effect [1284]describes how the parton’s transverse spin affects itshadronization.
The TMD factorization approach is more suitablefor evaluating the SSAs of scattering processes with twoobserved and very different momentum scales:Q1 ≫Q2 ≳ ΛQCD where Q1 is the hard scale whileQ2 is asoft scale sensitive to the active parton’s transverse mo-tion or momentum. For example, the Drell-Yan leptonpair production when Q ≫qT is a process that canbe studied in terms of the TMD factorization [1269].
In addition, the SIDIS when the transverse momentumof observed final-state hadronph ≪Q in the photon-hadron Breit frame is an ideal observable for study-ing AN, since the leading power contribution to theTMD factorization of SIDIS is known to be valid [1269,1285]. Although the AN in SIDIS can receive contri-bution from various sources, including the Sivers effect(Sivers function f⊥1T) and Collins effect (Collins func-tion H⊥1 ), as well as contribution from the pretzelositydistribution h⊥1T [1286], it is the choice of angular mod-ulation that allows us to separate these three sources ofcontributions in SIDIS,ASiversN ∝⟨sin(φh −φs)⟩UT ∝f⊥1T ⊗D (5.9.17)ACollinsN ∝⟨sin(φh + φs)⟩UT ∝h1 ⊗H⊥1 (5.9.18)APretzelosityN ∝⟨sin(3φh −φs)⟩UT ∝h⊥1T ⊗H⊥1 (5.9.19)178 5 APPROXIMATE QCDwhere D is the normal unpolarized FF, the subscript“UT” stands for unpolarized lepton and transverselypolarized hadron, φh is an angle between the leptonicplane and the hadronic plane in SIDIS andφs is theangle between the hadron transverse spin vector andthe leptonic plane.
The predictive power of TMD factorization leadsone to expect that the TMDs will be process-indepen-dent. However, it was found that the Sivers functionmeasured in SIDIS and that in Drell-Yan process coulddiffer by a sign. Such simple and generalized universal-ity should preserve the predictive power of TMD factor-ization approach. Theoretically, such sign change canbe better verified from the operator definition of theSivers function. The quark Sivers function is defined asthe spin-dependent part of the TMD parton distribu-tions [1298, 1310],fq/h↑(x,k⊥,s⊥) =∫ dy−d2y⊥(2π)3 eixp+y−e−i⃗k⊥·⃗ y⊥×⟨p,s⊥|¯ψ(0)W[0,y]ψ(y)|p,s⊥⟩|y+=0,(5.9.20)where W[0,y] is the gauge link for the leading powerinitial- and final-state interactions between the struckparton and the spectators or the remnant of the po-larized hadron. The form of the gauge links includ-ing the phase of the interactions depends on the colorflow of the scattering process and is process depen-dent. Luckily, the parity and time-reversal invarianceof QCD removes almost all process dependence of theTMDs. By applying Eq. (5.9.14) to the matrix elementin Eq. (5.9.20), we havefSIDISq/h↑ (x,k⊥,S⊥) = fDYq/h↑(x,k⊥,−S⊥) . (5.9.21)Therefore, the Sivers function has an opposite sign inSIDIS and DY [1308, 1311]. Experimentally, it is im-portant to verify such relationship.
In the collinear factorization approach, all activepartons’ transverse momenta are integrated into thecollinear distributions, and the explicit spin-transversemomentum correlation in the TMD approach is now in-cluded in the high twist collinear parton distributionsor fragmentation functions. Since the massless quarkin short-distance hard collisions cannot flip the spin inQCD, the SSAs in the collinear factorization approachare generated by quantum interference between a scat-tering amplitude with one active parton and an ampli-tudewithtwoactivepartons.Thenecessaryspin-flipforSSAs is achieved by angular momentum flip betweensingle active parton state and the state of two activepartons. Such nonperturbative effect is represented bytwist-3 collinear parton distributions or fragmentationfunctions, which has no probability interpretation, andthe spin flip was made possible by QCD color Lorentzforce [1302, 1303]. The collinear factorization approachis more relevant to the SSAs of scattering cross sec-tions with a single hard scaleQ≫ΛQCD. The validityof QCD factorization for SSA in the collinear factoriza-tion approach requires study of the collinear factoriza-tionbeyondtheleadingpower(ortwist-2)contribution.
It was demonstrated that QCD factorization worksfor the first sub-leading power contribution to the ha-dronic cross section, but, not beyond [1312]. That is,QCD factorization should work for the 1/Q2 powercorrection to inclusive and unpolarized Drell-Yan crosssection [1313], 1/p2T corrections to unpolarized singlehigh-pT particle production in hadron-hadron collisions[1314], and1/pT power correction to single high-pT par-ticle production in hadron-hadron collisions with oneof them transversely polarized [1302–1304, 1315]. It isthe QCD factorization for the1/pT power correction tosingle high transverse momentumpT particle produc-tion in hadron-hadron collisions with one of them trans-versely polarized that enables the systematic collinearfactorization approach to studyAN. For example, theSSA of single high-pT hadron production in hadroniccollisions, A(p,sT) + B(p′) →h(Ph) + X, can be fac-torized [1302, 1304]AN(sT) ∝T(3)(x,x,s T) ⊗ˆσ⊗Df(z)+δq(x,sT) ⊗ˆσD ⊗D(3)(z,z) + ... ,(5.9.22)where T(3) and D(3) are twist-3 three-parton corre-lation functions and fragmentation functions, respec-tively, andδq (or h1) is the leading power transversitydistribution, with “... ” representing a small contribu-tions [1316]. Various extractions ofT(3) and D(3) fromexperimental data have been carried out [1305, 1317].
TheSSAisaphysicallymeasuredquantityandshouldnot depend on how we describe it from QCD factor-ization or the choice of factorization scheme or scale,which leads to evolution equations of factorized non-perturbative distributions or twist-3 quark-gluon corre-lation functions relevant to the SSA [1318]. A completeset of the correlation functions was generated by in-serting (1) the field operator∫dy−1[iSTρ iϵρσT F +σ (y−1 )]into the matrix element of twist-2 PDFs, and (2) theoperator∫dy−1[iSσTF +σ (y−1 )]into the matrix elementof twist-2 helicity distributions [1318]. A close set ofevolution equations of these twist-3 correlation func-tions as well as the leading order evolution kernels werederived [1318–1320].
Although the two approaches each have their ownkinematic domain of validity, they are consistent witheach other in the perturbative regime to which theyboth apply[1321, 1322].5.10 Exclusive processes in QCD 1795.10 Exclusive processes in QCDGeorge Sterman5.10.1 Exclusive amplitudes for hadrons: geom-etry and counting rulesThe analysis of exclusive reactions played a role in thedevelopment of quantum chromodynamics, and becamea subject of ongoing research within QCD. This sectionreviews some of the early history, landmark develop-ments and ongoing research in this lively topic, concen-trating on wide-angle scattering. The reader is referredespecially to the preceding contribution on factoriza-tion in cross sections, to Sec.10 on the structure of thenucleon and Sec.11 on QCD at high energy for closelyrelated subject matter.
PrehistoryFor many years, exclusive reactions were the languageof experimental strong interaction physics at accelera-tors. In such reactions, up to low GeV energies (BeV atthe time), new resonances were found, whose quantumnumbers were revealed in the analysis of their decays.
As energies increased, the analysis of exclusive reac-tionsgaverisetotheoreticaladvanceslikeReggetheory,and the Veneziano amplitude [7], resulting eventually instring theory. Around the same time, the quark modelfor hadron spectroscopy was developed.
With the advent of multi-GeV hadronic and lep-tonic accelerators, any nonforward exclusive final statebecame a small part of the cross section. Nevertheless,if we assume that elastic scattering results directly frompairwise scattering amplitudes for constituent quarks,simplecountingcombinedwiththeopticaltheoremleadsto successful predictions on the ratios of total cross sec-tions [1323]. Other pioneering concepts introduce a ge-ometrical picture of colliding hadrons, whose interac-tions extend over their entire overlap during the scat-tering [1324]. This picture is agnostic on the dynamicalnature of the strong interactions that mediate momen-tum transfer. The dual amplitudes of Ref. [7] are expo-nentially suppressed for fixed-angle scattering, and in-deed, exponential fall-off in|t|is characteristic of near-forward cross sections at high energy [1325]. For|t|inthe range of a few GeV, however, this decrease mod-erates to a power. This, along with the observationof power-law fall-off for form factors [563] suggestedthat fixed-angle amplitudes might, indeed must, reflecta point-like substructure for nucleons and mesons. Thissection will review some of the guiding developmentsin this area, which grew along with QCD, and whichcontinue to shape contemporary theoretical and exper-imental programs.
Hadrons in the language of partons.
Hadrons are bound states, whose fine-grained proper-ties are nonperturbative, yet based in the interactionsof the quarks and gluons that appear in the Lagrangiandensity of QCD. To describe how partons can mediatethe scattering of hadrons, we introduce a Fock spacepicture of the hadronic state with on-shell momentum,in terms ofP+ = (1/√2)(P0 + P3), massmH and spinsH, as [792]|H,P +,sH⟩ =∑FHcF |{fi,xi,ki,⊥,λi}FH⟩, (5.10.1)where the infinite sum is over partonic Fock states,FH,eachconsistingofasetofconstituents, {fi... },labelledby flavors,fi, by the fractionxi of ⃗PH, transverse mo-mentaki,⊥ and helicityλi. In QCD, the Fock states arelabelled as well by the manner in which the colors ofconstituents combine to form color singlets. From thesestates, in principle, we can construct any of the univer-sal quantities of perturbative QCD that can be writtenas expectation values of the hadronic state, includingcollinear and transverse momentum parton distribu-tions. Here, however, we will for the most part make useof only the valence state,Fval, with three constituentsfor a nucleon, two for a meson. Of course, we assumethat cFval is nonzero in Eq. (5.10.1). The Fock stateformalism puts this approximation in context, pointingthe way to systematic expansions.
Constituent counting.
Influenced by the success of the parton model appliedto quarks, and assuming a constituent expansion likethe one just described, Brodsky and Farrar [1326], andMatveev,MuradianandTavkhelidze[ 1012]realizedthatunderbroadassumptionsonthestronginteractions,thebehavior in momentum transfer of a wide range of ex-clusive processes can be summarized by a simple rule,which goes under the name of quark, or more gener-ally constituent, counting. We can see how this worksby considering the very high-energy elastic scatteringof two hadrons, in the first instance assumed to con-sist of a fixed set of “valence” partons, specified by thequark model ([uud] for the proton, for example), mov-ing within a limited region of space, which we can thinkof a sphere of radiusRH for hadronH.
Following the intuitive analysis of partons in deep-inelastic scattering, we imagine that hadrons can bethoughtofasLorentzcontractedandtimedilated.Largemomentumtransferrequiresall ni valence(anti-)quarksof the initial-state hadronsito arrive within a region of180 5 APPROXIMATE QCDRi1/QJust beforeJust afterFig. 5.10.1 The geometry of constituent counting forπ− πscattering (ni = 2 ).

area 1/Q2, whereQ is the momentumm transfer. Nowthe hadrons don’t know they are going to collide, so weassume their partons are more or less randomly scat-teredaboutwithintheareasoftheirLorentz-contractedwave functions. Then the likelihood for them all to bewithin this small area is of order( 1Q2 × 1πR2H)ni−1for each hadron of radiusRH. But this must also betrue of both incoming and outgoing states, so that theirwave functions may overlap.
At the moment of collision, we don’t have to makean assumption on the details of the hard scattering thatredirects the partons, but we assume that otherwise theamplitude is a function only of the scattering angle.
Then, at fixed t/s (that is fixed center of mass scat-tering angle), we find the quark counting rules of Refs.
[1012] and [1326],dσdt = f(t/s)s2( 1sπR2H)∑4i=1 (ni− 1). (5.10.2)Figure5.10.1illustratesthescalesinvolved,andthesys-tem just before and after the hard scattering. This re-lation provides a set of predictions for power-behavior,for example dσpp→pp/dt ∝ s−10, which are generallysuccessful [1328]. The determination of normalizationswould require, of course, control over the short-distanceinteractions of the constituents, to which we will re-turn below. For applications of these ideas to nuclei,see Sec. 5.2.
Quark exchange, spin and transparency.
Before going further into the technical status of exclu-sive amplitudes, it is natural to observe several fun-damental consequences of this picture. First, assumingthat the integrals over fractional momenta are insensi-tive to the endpoints, the rules of quark counting followimmediately by dimensional counting in the (in prin-ciple) calculable partonic scattering amplitudes. Thepicture is quite general, and applies as well to lepton-hadron elastic scattering. The constituent rules thendetermine the power behavior of hadronic form factorsin momentum transfer,Q: Q−2 for mesons andQ−4 forbaryons. In all processes, any scattering mediated bylarger numbers of constituents is power-suppressed.
In the scattering of hadrons, there are generallymany ways in which quarks can flow from the initial tothe final state. Almost all of these describe quark ex-change, whether in elastic scattering likeπ+p →π+p,but especially for charge-exchange exclusive processes,like π−p → π0n. The valence Fock states describedabove, considered as functions of the transverse mo-menta of the constituents, can be used to construct apicture of 2 → 2 exclusive amplitudes based on theoverlaps of incoming and outgoing states. These con-siderations lead to a variety of quite successful predic-tions for dependence on momentum transfer [1329]. Aparticularly striking example is the difference betweenproton-proton and antiproton-proton scattering, wherethe latter provides no opportunity for quark exchange.
The ratio of these cross sections is about forty to one[1329].
For hadrons with light-quark valence structure (pi-ons, nucleons) we anticipate that the scatterings will becomputed with zero quark masses. Then, in any theorybased on the exchange of vector gluons, the helicitiesof the quarks are conserved, and since the scatteringis in valence states at small transverse sizes, the helici-ties of the valence states directly determine the spinsof the external hadrons. This feature leads to manypredictions for amplitudes in which spins are preparedand measured [1328]. Unlike constituent counting rules,however, predictions for spin more often fail; for the ex-ample of proton-proton scattering, see Ref. [785].
Finally, specializing to color-singlet hadrons in atheory with colored quarks, another fundamental pre-dictionofthispictureis transparency[1330],whichrefersto predictions for exclusive hard-scattering in nuclei.
On the one hand, exclusive scattering emerges onlyfrom valence parton configurations, with all partons ina small regions of coordinate space. On the other hand,at high energies, the lifetime of such a virtual state is di-lated by a large factor. Thus we anticipate thatboth theincoming and outgoing hadrons in an exclusive reactionpropagate as effectively point-like particles through thesurrounding medium, in particular, through a nucleus.
For proton-nucleon elastic scattering with momentum5.10 Exclusive processes in QCD 181transferQ, the incoming proton must be in a state of ef-fective area1/Q2 on its way into the nucleus, and willbe invisible to the color fields of nucleons it encoun-ters, whose partons are typically spread out over scalesof the order of the proton’s radius. Only when it en-counters a constituent nucleon that happens to be in acorresponding tiny valence state can it undergo elasticscattering, producing again a pair of “stealth” nucle-ons that are just as invisible on the way out. While theamplitude for this to happen remains just as small asfor free proton-proton or proton-neutron scattering, itis not suppressed by initial- or final-state interactions,in contrast to most cross sections on nuclei. These con-siderations are summarized in the elegant prediction forscattering on a nucleus of atomic numberZ,dσdt [p+ Z →p+ p+ (Z−1)]s→∞,t/s ﬁxed→ Zdσdt [p+ p→p+ p] . (5.10.3)This is the case, at least asymptotically, and the man-ner in which asymptotic behavior is reached for variedelastic reactions is a subject of ongoing experimental(see for example, Refs. [210, 1331]) and theoretical in-vestigation [1332, 1333].
Splitting the hard scattering: Landshoff mechanism.
Withoutfurtherassumptions,thesamegeometric-par-tonic considerations sketched above can lead to an al-ternative picture and prediction for asymptotic behav-ior, first formulated by Landshoff [1334]. To be spe-cific,let’sconsidermeson-mesonelasticscattering( ni =nf = 2 ). Then, instead of a single short-distance scat-tering involving all four incoming and outgoing partons,we imagine two independent hard scatterings of partonpairs, each resulting in two pairs of partons travelling inthe same direction, and forming the outgoing mesons.
The geometric picture is shown in Fig.5.10.2. We as-sume that the separationb between the short-distancecollisions of individual pairs of partons is generically oforder RH, the hadronic radius61 Relative to the strictshort-distance picture of Fig.5.10.1, this reaction is en-hanced by the ratioRH/(1/Q) = RHQ in the ampli-tude for mesons, which is the ratio of the scale of thehard scattering to the size of the overlap between thehadrons, as shown in the figure. Similarly, there is anenhancement of(RHQ)2 for baryons, for whichdσdt = f(t/s)s2( 1sπR2H)6. (5.10.4)Intheforwardregionwithastill-largemomentumtrans-fer, s≫−t≫ΛQCD, we anticipate a factor1/Q2 ∼1/t61 We will come back to this assumption below.

for each hard scattering, and we finddσdt = f(0)t2( 1tπR2H)6. (5.10.5)Experimentally, at wide angles, data appear to preferthedirectcountingbehaviorofEq.( 5.10.2),butatlarget and even highers, a behavior like Eq. (5.10.5) is ob-served [1335, 1336].
5.10.2 Computing hard exclusive amplitudes inQCDThe considerations described above are based in theparton model, although they are a significant step be-yond the classical parton model results, because thehard scattering is itself a strong interaction. With theseconcepts in hand, the next great step was to applyfield theoretic analysis to elastic scattering, relying onasymptotic freedom to calculate short distance inter-actions where large momenta are exchanged, and onideas of factorization to separate the dynamics bind-ing each hadron from the short distance scattering andfrom each other. Before we review this landmark anal-ysis for exclusive processes with hadrons, it is usefulto touch on elastic scattering amplitudes for partons.
These, of course, are not directly physical, but theyplay an important role in the factorized hadronic anal-ysis that follows, and also in other areas, particularlyjet cross sections.
Partons: exclusive amplitudes in QCD.
We consider partonic scattering amplitudes at “wideangles”, labelling the combination of incoming and out-going (massless) partons and their momenta asf,f : f1(p1)+f2(p2) →f3(p3)+f4(p4)+···+fn+2(pn+2) .
(5.10.6)To define such an amplitude in perturbation theory re-quires the regulation of infrared singularities associated182 5 APPROXIMATE QCDwith the virtual states that include zero-momentumlines and/or lines collinear to the external particles.
This is conventionally done by dimensional regulariza-tion, that is, by treating the number of dimensions asa parameter, d = 4 −2ε, and continuingε away fromzero. Starting at one loop, infrared singularities man-ifest themselves as poles inε, generally two per loop.
Despite the growing order of the poles, the amplitudecan be written in a factorized form, [1337–1339]M[f]L(vi,Q2µ2 ,αs(µ2),ε)=∏i∈fJ[i](Q′2µ2 ,αs(µ2),ε)×S[f]LI(vi,Q2µ2 ,αs(µ2),ε)H[f]I(βi,Q2µ2 ,αs(µ2),s).(5.10.7)In this expression, the functionsJ[i] contain all polesin ε due to virtual lines collinear to the velocities, de-noted vi (v2i = 0 ) of the massless external partonsi.
These infrared poles are universal among the ampli-tudes of different partonic scattering processes. That is,they only depend on the whether the external partonis an (anti)quark or gluon. The infrared factors divergeveryrapidlyas ε→0,thatis,infourdimensions. Manydetails can be found in Ref. [1340], but to get an ideaof the strength of the infrared singularities, it is suffi-cient to see leading poles of the two-loop exponent ofa jet function, given in terms of its expansion in termsanomalous dimensionsγ[i]K,J[i](Q2µ2 ,αs(µ2),ε)∼exp{−(αs8π)(1ε2 γ[i] (1)K)+(αsπ)2[β081ε234εγ[i](1)K −12(γ[i](2)K4ε2)]+ ...

(5.10.8)Here γ[i]K = ∑nγ[i](n)K (αs/π)n is the coefficient of the1/[1−x]+ term of the DGLAP evolution kernel for par-ton i, often denotedAi(αs), withγ[q](1)K = CF, andβ0 isthe lowest-order coefficient of the QCD beta function.
The analysis that leads to the exponentiation of doubleinfraredpolesforpartonicamplitudesreliesonenhance-ments of radiation by accelerated massless charged par-ticles at low angle and energy in gauge theories. Thesystematic treatment of these effects often goes by thename“Sudakovresummation”,atermwewillencounterbelow when we return to the Landshoff mechanism.
In Eq. (5.10.7), S[f]L is a matrix in the space ofcolorexchanges,labelledbycolortensor L(forexample,octet or singlet exchange), which contains the remain-ing poles, all due to virtual lines with vanishing mo-menta. The soft matrix,S[f]L also has an expression interms of calculable “soft” anomalous dimensions, whichhave wide uses in inclusive as well as exclusive cross sec-tions. The remaining set of functions,H[f]l are free ofinfrared poles and contain all dependence on momen-tum transfers.
Hadrons: Factorization and evolution for form factorsand exclusive amplitudes.
Historically, the analysis of hadronic exclusive ampli-tudes in QCD predated that for partonic amplitudesjust discussed. This was possible because in these am-plitudes external particles are, by construction, colorsinglets. We assume that the picture given above forquark counting still applies, that the elastic amplitudesresult from redirecting valence quarks and antiquarksinto collinear configurations in the final state, and thatthoseconfigurationsarecolorsinglets.Thenpurelysoft,as opposed to collinear, singularities disappear. Com-paring to the partonic amplitude, Eq. (5.10.7), we de-rive an expression for the hadronic amplitude without asoft matrix, and with dimensionally-regularized jet fuc-tions replaced by hadronic wave functions [206, 207,1272]. A short-distance, hard-scattering function de-noted H describes the short-distance scattering ofnivalence quarks/antiquarks from each external hadron,i. The general form, in this case for2 →2 scattering,isM(s,t; λi) =∫ 4∏i=1[dxi] φi(xi,m,λi,µ)×H(xi,nxj,mpi ·pjµ2 ; λi). (5.10.9)In contrast to partonic scattering, which describes theshort-distance scattering of a single physical parton foreach direction, hadronic wave functions,φi(xi,m,λi,µ),depend on how their valence partons share the momen-tum of their external hadron, labelled by fractionsxi,m,∑mxi,m = 1. Hadronic helicities, labelled byλi, deter-mine spin projections for the quark constituents of thevalencestate.Theintegralsoverfractionalmomentaaredenoted (here, for baryons) by the notation,[dxi] = dxi,1dxi,2dxi,3 δ(1 −3∑n=1xi,n). (5.10.10)The factorization requires the choice of a factorizationscale, µ, which is naturally of the order of the renor-malization scale for the matrix element that defines thewave functionsφ(xi,λi,µ). A representative example isforπ+,whosewavefunctionisthematrixelementofthevalencequarkoperatorsthatabsorbanupquarkandananti-down quark, between the single-pion state and theQCD vacuum. In this case, definingx1 = 1 −x2 ≡xas the fraction of the up quark, the expression (in a5.10 Exclusive processes in QCD 183physical gauge) isφπ(x,µ) = p·n∫ ∞−∞dλ4πei(xp)·(λn)×⟨0|¯d(0) n·γγ52√2ncu(λn)|π+(p)⟩, (5.10.11)where the vectornµ is light-like and oppositely directedto the pion’s momentumpµ, and nc is the number ofcolors. The matrix element requires renormalization be-cause its fields are separated by a light-like distance,proportional tonµ.
We note the many similarities between the exclusiveamplitudes Eq. (5.10.9) and factorized forms of inclu-sive cross sections in deep-inelastic and hadron-hadronscattering. The role of wave functions here is played byparton distributions there, and in both cases there is aconvolution in partonic momentum fraction(s). In bothcases also, the presence of a factorization scale,µ, im-plies evolution equations, there for parton distributionsand here for wave functions,µ ∂∂µ φ(x,µ) =∫ 10dyV (x,y,α s(µ)) φ(y,µ) .(5.10.12)The evolution kernelV(x,y,α s) incorporates cancella-tions between constituent self-energies and diagramswith gluons exchanged between constituents. In gen-eral, the factorization scale is proportional to the mo-mentum transfer, and these evolution equations makeit possible to extrapolate wave functions (and partondistributions) from one scale to another. While spacedoes not allow a review of the kernel and the solu-tions of these equations here, an especially beautifulconsequence of the particular evolution equations forpion wave functions is that at asymptotically largeµthe wave functions approach known, fixed, finite ex-pressions,limµ→∞φπ(x,µ) = 3fπ√ncx(1 −x) , (5.10.13)where fπ is the pion decay constant and againnc thenumber of colors (3 for QCD of course). Again, thisis a consequence of the detailed nature of the kernelin the evolution equation, (5.10.12), which follows inturn from the underlying factorization for hard exclu-sive processes, Eq. (5.10.9).
Exceptional momentum configurations.
In their original form, the factorized amplitudes of Eq.
(5.10.9) apply to a very wide set of processes, includingelastic form factors for pions and mesons, for which theexternal leptons can be counted as if they were hadronswith a single parton. Like any such factorized expres-sion, however, its predictive power depends on its sta-bility under higher-order corrections. Of particular in-terest are the limits where one fractional momentaxiapproaches unity and the others vanish, a configurationfor elastic scattering often referred to as the Feynmanmechanism (see Lecture 29 of Ref. [1341]). Noting theexample of Eq. (5.10.13), we generally expect, and incase of pions in the valence state can prove, that wavefunctions vanish sufficiently rapidly in these limits topreserve the stability of the factorized amplitude in Eq.
(5.10.9). The onset of this limit is not easy to deter-mine, however, and has been the subject of discussionin the literature. For form factors particularly, alterna-tive treatments based on dispersion relations and QCDsum rules, provide an alternative picture for currentlyaccessible momentum transfers [1342]. The situation forbaryonic wave functions is even more complex, becausethe Feynman mechanism is not suppressed at fixed or-ders [1343]. At high momentum transfers, this may beresolved by higher-order corrections [1344] (see below),but phenomenological analyses based on the Feynmanmechanism are also of interest [1345].
Another point of concern is the Landshoff mecha-nism identified above, in which subsets of the partonsscatter elastically at different points in the space trans-verse to the beam directions, as in Fig. 5.10.2. Thisprocess is actually lower order inαs, but more impor-tantly it is sensitive to the transverse structure of theexternal hadrons, that is, on information that is notincluded in the wave functions discussed above. How-ever, the resummation of higher-order QCD correctionsshows that large transverse separations are suppressed,returning us to expectations very similar to those of Eq.
(5.10.9).
Sudakov resummation and asymptotic behavior.
As we have seen in Fig.5.10.2 and Eq. (5.10.4), theLandshoff enhancement to inclusive amplitudes is dueto the assumed possibility of separating hard scatter-ingsbetweensubsetsofvalencepartons.Asnotedabove,to estimate the enhancement we assume that the sep-aration is generically of the order of the hadronic ra-dius. The analysis through Sudakov resummation fol-lows from the observation that the separation of par-tonic hard scatterings in an overall hadronic exclusiveamplitude requires the scattering of isolated non-singletcolor charges without radiation. In isolation, these ac-celerated charges would result in infrared singularities,as in Eq. (5.10.8) above, which would make the am-plitude vanish in four dimensions. In our case, how-ever, the outgoing configurations of the scattered par-tons are almost collinear, and the divergences (infraredpoles) cancel. The larger the separationb between thehard scatterings, however, the larger the finite remain-der. The result is that any process with separated hardscatterings is suppressed relative to the acceleration of184 5 APPROXIMATE QCDPPPP1234bb12xy1-x-yxy1-x-yFig. 5.10.3Transverse separations in a multiple hard scatter-ing. Note that the eight potentially independent integrals overmomentum fractions are replaced by only two integrals, thesame for each external hadron. From Ref. [1327].
locally singlet charge configurations, which shows thatthe assumption of separated hard scatterings amongpairs of partons made in our analysis of the Landshoffmechanism was not in fact warranted.
Theobservationsabove,whicharethebasisoftrans-parency, can be quantified, by treating the distance be-tween the hard scatterings in Fig.5.10.2 as an impactfactor, b, conjugate to transverse momentum. An anal-ysis treating both transverse and longitudinal momentaof quarks leads to a factorized expression for hadronicscattering amplitude in terms of a wave function thatdepends on both the quark transverse momentum andlongitudinal momentum fraction. As with the classicform, Eq. (5.10.9), there is a close analogy to partondistributions encountered in inclusive cross sections, inthis case transverse momentum distributions (TMDs).
The necessary wave functions generalize the light-conematrix elements like Eq. (5.10.11) by displacing thefields in transverse (impact parameter) directions rel-ative to the opposite-moving light cone.
This factorization in impact parameter space re-quires a soft matrix, which ties together soft radiationfrom the two (or three) separated hard scatterings inFig. 5.10.2. Referring to the diagram in Fig.5.10.3 fora baryonic exclusive process, we anticipate a perturba-tive suppression whenever the distances between hardscatterings, b1 and b2 in the figure, increase beyond thescale of the momentum transfer. For this process, wenote that all four partons external to each hard scat-tering must carry the same momentum fraction. So theeight integrals over momentum fractions are reduced totwo, which we labelx and y here.
TheformoffactorizationcorrespondingtoFig. 5.10.3isthengivenatscatteringangle θandmomentumtrans-fer Q by [1346]M(s,t) = 12π2 sin2 θ∑f∫ 10dxdyθ(1 −x−y)×∫db1db2 Trcolor[U(biQ)H1H2H3]×∏i=1,2,3,4Ri(x,y,b 1,b2) , (5.10.14)where the color Trace[U(biQ)H1H2H3]ties color to-gether and includesϵabc for colors of three quarks, withpossible color exchange in each hard scattering,Hi(xip1,xip2,xip3,xip4) ∼1/(xiQ)2.
In Eq. (5.10.14) we may define x1 = x, x2 = y andx3 = 1 −x−y.
The wave functions, R(x,y,b 1,b2) drive the sup-pression of largebi, and behave asRi(x,y,b i) ∼φi(x,y,b 1,b2,µ ∼1/⟨b⟩)×exp[−αsπ γ[q][1]K3∑a=1ln2( 1xaQba)], (5.10.15)where γ[q]K is the same anomalous dimension as for thequark jets in the partonic amplitude, Eq. (5.10.8). Theφi(x,y, 1/⟨b⟩) are normal partonic wave functions of theform encountered above, now evaluated at a renormal-ization scale set by the inverse of the average impactparameter spacing between the hard scatterings. Theexponential suppression by double logarithms ofb inEq. (5.10.15) is the result of the systematic treatmentof states with soft and collinear virtual radiation, andis thus an example of Sudakov resummation [1347]. Itforces the impact parameters to vanish, on a scale thatis for all intents and purposes of order1/√−t. Com-bined with the1/tbehaviors of the three partonic hardscatterings, the full amplitude behaves as nearly1/t4,consistent with the original constituent counting rulesof Eq. (5.10.2). The momentum transfer at which thisbehavior sets in, however, may be quite large, especiallygiven the factors ofxand y, which are always less thanunity, in the arguments of logarithms.
5.10.3 T oward the futureThe true asymptotic behavior of many exclusive reac-tions in QCD is by now well characterized, but muchremains to be understood. In particular, it is not fullyclear to what extent the success of constituent count-ing rules provides us with a quantitative understand-ing of the normalizations of amplitudes at accessiblemomentum transfers, and when to expect predictions5.11 Color confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and gauge topology 185based on helicity conservation and transparency to ap-ply. Progress in these directions will be part of the fu-ture of QCD, a future in which the gap between par-tonic and hadronic degrees of freedom is bridged.
5.11 Color confinement, chiral symmetrybreaking, and gauge topologyEdward Shuryak5.11.1 OverviewNontrivial topological structures of non-Abelian gaugefields were discovered in the 1970’s, starting with the’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole [1348, 1349] and Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin (BPST) instanton [1350].
These two sets of objects were soon related to two mainnonperturbative phenomena – confinement and chiralsymmetry breaking. Confinement was connected to thesocalled“dualsuperconductor”model[ 1348,1351]mag-netically charged monopole condensate expelling color-electricfieldsintofluxtubes.Instantons,describingvac-uumtunnelingbetweentopologicalbarriers,havefermionicbound states – technically calledzero modes – and inthe QCD vacuum are “collectivised” into quark con-densates which break theSU(Nf)A and U(1)A chiralsymmetries of massless QCD. For decades, theory andphenomenology of monopoles and instantons were de-veloped separately, but in the last two decades, follow-ing a breakthrough paper by Kraan and van Baal [1352]studies ofdeconfinement and chiral symmetry restora-tion phase transitions, based on new semiclassical ob-jects, called instanton-monopoles or instanton - dyonslead to a united quantitative description of both phasetransitions, in QCD and even in its “deformed” ver-sions.
5.11.2 Color confinement and deconfinementDiscovery of QCD 50 years ago put into motion manyimportant developments in the 1970’s. Asymptotic free-dom led to a weak coupling regime at small distancesand a flourishing “perturbative QCD” describing hardprocesses. Going in the opposite direction (small mo-menta or large distance, also called “infrared” or IR),one finds growing QCD coupling. In pure gauge the-ories the potential energy of a static quark and anti-quark pair grows linearly with increasing separation,V(Rq¯q) ∼σRq¯q. Therefore, with a finite amount of en-ergy one cannot separate color charges: they are “con-fined”. Furthermore, all electric fields are expelled fromthe vacuum and get confined as well, into so called“electric flux tubes” (also known as ”QCD strings”).
Their “tension” (energy per length) isσ ≈1 GeV/fm.
In QCD with dynamical quarks, a newq¯q pair can becreated, breaking the flux tube into two. Yet it is stilltrue that any objects with nonzero color charge – suchas quarks and gluons – do not exist as independentphysical objects in the QCD vacuum. This is one of thedefinitions of “color confinement.”Thisattractivepictureofcourseneededtobetested.
K. Wilson [80] promoted the statement about a linearpotential to a more abstract mathematical form: thevacuum expectation value of the Wilson lineW =⣨ 1NcTrP exp(i∫CdxµAaµTa)⟩, (5.11.1)over some contourC of sufficiently large size with colorgauge fields. HereTa are color algebra generators, andPexp means products of exponents along a given con-tour C. Wilson’s criterium states that in confining the-oriesW = exp[−σ∗Area(C)] (5.11.2)falls exponentially with the area of a surface inclosedby the contourC. If it is a rectangular contourT ∗Lin 0 - 1 plane, thearea = T ∗L and σ is then iden-tified with the string tension. The very first numericalstudies of non-Abelian gauge theory on the lattice, byM.Creutz [329] indeed found that the area law holdsfor large enough loops, and thatσ is indeed physical,that is it has correct dependence on the coupling as dic-tated by asymptotic freedom. (Needless to say, numeri-cal evidence is not taken for a proof by mathematicallyinclined folks, and an analytic proof is still missing. Amillion dollar prize for such a proof still waits to beawarded.)In Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) charge renor-malization makes the couplinglarger at small distances(large momenta transfers or UV limit), butsmall atlarge distances, which is explained by very intuitive“vacuum polarization” picture, in which virtuale+e−pairs screen the charges. Screening of the charges by aQED medium – e.g. plasma of the Sun – is well knownand tested.
Onemaynowaskwhathappensina“QCDmedium”.
Asymptotic freedom tells us that, contrary to QED, atsmalldistancesthecoupling decreases.Butwhatwouldhappen at large distances? Calculation of the polariza-tion tensor [1353] had shown that, like in QED, themedium screensthe charges. Therefore, at high enoughtemperature the interaction becomes weak at all dis-tances. Therefore hot/dense QCD matter must be in aphase called a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). It is the“normal phase” of QCD in which fields in the QCD186 5 APPROXIMATE QCDLagrangian – quarks and gluons – correspond to quasi-particles which move relatively freely. It must be dis-tinct from the QCD vacuum and low-T hadronic phase,as there is no place for confinement, chiral condensateand other nonperturbative phenomena there. The “con-fining” QCD vacuum and the QGP must therefore beseparated by a phase transition: and it is indeed seenin experiment and lattice studies, which now put thecritical temperature atTdeconﬁnement ≈155 MeV .
As discussed in detail in section on symmetries ofQCD, at vanishing quark masses it has additionalchi-ral symmetries .Withoutmassterms,intheLagrangianthe left and right-polarized components do not directlyinteract with each other and independent flavor rota-tions become possible. Such doubled flavor symmetrycan be decomposed into avector (the sum) and the ax-ial (the L-R difference) symmetries. One of them, calledaxial SU(Nf)A symmetry (Nf = 3 is the number oflight quark flavors,u,d,s ), is spontaneously broken inthe QCD vacuum, which possesses a nonzeroquark con-densate ⟨¯qq⟩̸= 0 . The melting (disappearance) of thiscondensate should happen at another transitionT >Tchiral. Although in various settings Tdeconﬁnement ̸=Tchiral, in QCD they seem to coincide, again based onnumerical lattice evidence.
Another chiral symmetry calledU(1)A is broken bythe quantum anomaly and is not actually a symmetryat all. (“Anomaly” means that while it is a symmetryof the Lagrangian, it is not a symmetry of the quantumpartition function.)5.11.3 Electric-magnetic duality and monopolesAlready our brief discussion above should have con-vinced the reader that the QCD vacuum is quite com-plicated, with one outstanding feature being the expul-sion of color-electric fields into the flux tube. Already,in the 1970’s [1351, 1354, 1355], an analogy betweenthis phenomenon and an expulsion of magnetic fieldsfrom superconductors lead to the so called“dual super-conductor” model of confinement.
In superconductors of the second kind there existthe so called magnetic flux tubes orfluxons. Magneticfields are confined inside the tubes because of solenoidal(super)current of Cooper pairs on their surface. QCDflux tubes transfer flux of electric field instead. Theword “dual” is used indicating that one has to inter-change electric and magnetic fields. If so, the currentin the solenoid needs to be magnetic. What can it bemade of?The apparent asymmetry of Maxwellian electrody-namics bothered theorists since late 1800’s: can one al-low magnetic charges, by adding a nonzero r.h.s. to the∇· ⃗B equation? An interesting motion for a set of elec-tric and magnetic charges was predicted by J.J.Thom-son and H.Poincare. With discovery of quantum me-chanics, Dirac [1356] famously observed that if theyexist, then consistency of the theory requires that theproduct f electric and magnetic coupling to be quan-tized. As he emphasized, the existence of one monopolein the Universe would be enough to demand quantiza-tion of all electric charges, an empirical fact to whichnootherexplanationexisted.QEDmagneticmonopoleshave been looked for in exceedingly more sensitive ex-periments, but so far none have been found.
Yet certain Non-Abelian gauge theories with ad-joint scalars do possess solitonic magnetic monopolesolutions of the equations of motion, as discovered in-dependently by ′t Hooft and Polyakov [1348, 1349] .
Their prominent feature is that theirmagnetic chargescomply with earlier ideas by Dirac about special con-ditions, making “invisible” Dirac strings and allowingcoexistence of magnetic and electric charges in quan-tum settings. Here we cannot give justice to the explicitsolution and its properties: the interested reader canfind a detailed pedagogical description in books such as[1357]. Now, monopoles made of glue and scalars arebosons, so at low enough temperature their ensembleshould undergo Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC). Ifthat happens, a “magnetically charged” monopole con-densate would expel the (color)electric field intoelectricconfining flux tubes , and explain confinement!Seiberg and Witten [1217] have given an analyticproof in theories with more than one supersymmetry(which possess the needed adjoint scalars). They wereable to get the exact dependence of the effective elec-tric coupling on the vacuum expectation value (VEV)of the scalarg2(⟨φ⟩). When the VEV is large, the theoryis similar to electroweak theory, with gluons and gluinosbeing light and weakly interacting, and monopoles veryheavy. When the VEV decreases, the coupling increasesto O(1), and magnetic monopoles and dyons (particleswith both electric and magnetic charges) have massescomparable to that of gluons and gluinos. Finally, nearcertain singular points the electric coupling goes in-finitely strong, with gluons and gluinos much heavierthan monopoles. An effective desciption in this regimeis dual QED describing magnetic interactions of lightmonopoles.Theremarkablefactisthatoppositemotionof electric and magnetic couplings follows exactly the“consistency condition” of QEDgelectric ·gmagnetic =constpointed out by Dirac [1356] nearly a century ago!All this is very beautiful, creating significant theo-reticalactivityattheturnofthecentury,butweneedtoreturn to QCD. It doesnothave adjoint scalar fields, soonecannotdirectlybuild’tHooft-Polyakovmonopoles.5.11 Color confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and gauge topology 187E(ee)B(m)Fig. 5.11.1Upper panel: QCD electric flux tube in QCD vac-uum (upper) and magnetic flux tube in superconductor (lower).
The current rotated around is made of monopoles (upper) andCooper pairs (lower), respectively. Lower panel: plot shows thelattice data on the distribution of the electric field strength(squares) and the monopole Bose condensate (discs) in cylin-drical coordinates versus the distance in the transverse plane.
As one can see, the field is maximal at the center where themonopole condensate vanishes. The flux tube is generated bytwo static quark-antiquark external sources (not shown). Thelines correspond to a solution to (dual) Ginzburg-Landau equa-tions.
However, by special procedures, it was possible to iden-tify monopoles on the lattice, and locate their pathsand correlations. It was observed, in particular, thatthese monopoles do indeed rotate around the confin-ing flux tubes, producing solenoidal magnetic currentsneeded to stabilize them. The picture turns out to bea dual copy (meaning interchange electric↔magnetic)to well known magnetic flux tubes in superconductors.
Fig.5.11.1 (displaying the result of lattice simulationssummarized in the review [1358]) shows the distribu-tion of the electric field and magnetic monopole con-densate in a plane transverse to the electric flux tube.
Furthermore, it has been shown[1359] that BEC phasetransitionofmonopolesdoescoincidewiththe deconfin-ment transition at finite temperatureTc of (pure gauge)theories.
Ensembles of monopoles in QCD were studied, withimportant applications. Monopole correlations revealCoulomb-likeforcesbetweenmonopoles[ 1360],withtheircharges “running” in the direction opposite to that ofelectric charges [1361], exactly as predicted by Dirac!It has been shown [1362] that monopoles also play im-portant role in deconfined QGP phase atT > Tc: inparticular they dominate jet quenching in quark-gluonplasmas created in heavy ion collisions, and explain un-usually small viscosities observed.

(bottom) Effective chemical potentialµeff(T) isversus temperature, vanishes at the critical temperature.188 5 APPROXIMATE QCDThe idea of Bose-clusters is explained in the toppane of Fig.5.11.2: identical bosons may have “peri-odic paths” in which some numberk of them exchangeplaces. Such clusters are widely known to the commu-nity doing many body path integral simulations forbosons, e.g. liquid He4. Feynman argued that in or-der for the statistical sum to be singular at Tc, thesum overk must diverge. In other words, one may seehow the probability to observek-clusters Pk grows asT →Tc from above. In Fig.5.11.2(middle) from [1359]one sees the corresponding data for the cluster density.
Their dependence onk was fitted by two expressions,ρk ∼ exp (−kµeﬀ(T)) /k5/2 or the same without thek−5/2 factor, to show that the critical T is not sen-sitive to these details of the fit. The effective chemi-cal potentialµeﬀ(T) plotted versus temperature in thebottom panel of Fig.5.11.2. vanishes exactly at the de-confinement temperature T = Tc (defined by differentmethods). This means that monopoles indeed undergoBose-Einstein condensation at exactlyT = Tc.
5.11.4 T opological landscapeMagnetic monopoles were only the first of the solitons(solutions to nonlinear classical equations of motion,stable in the sector with fixed topology). In fact thereexist a whole zoo of them, even in pure gauge theorywithout any scalar fields.
Gauge symmetry of QCD allow transformations offields with arbitrary SU(3) matrices Ω(x), with arbi-trary dependence on space-time pointx. Those matri-ces can be divided into topologically distinct classes.
Introducing the Chern-Simons numberNCS [1363] forthe gauge potentialsNCS ≡ϵαβγ16π2∫d3x(Aaα∂βAaγ + 13ϵabcAaαAbβAcγ),(5.11.3)one may prove that if it is an integer, then the gaugeconfiguration with minimal energy is “pure gauge”, thefield strength Gaµν=0 and the minimal energy is zero.
Thusthevaluesof NCS numerate“classicalvacua”withdifferent topologies.
Yet whenNCS is in between these integers, the fieldstrength and the minimal energy isnonzero. This cre-ates a “topological landscape”, an infinite sequence ofclassical vacua separated bybarriers, see Fig.5.11.3. Byminimizing the energy at fixedNCS (and r.m.s. sizeρ)of the configurations, one can find [1364] the shape ofenergyChern-Simons number is integer at the “valleys”0 1 2Instanton is Tunneling at Zero energySphaleronSphaleron pathTerminology of the topological landscapeSphaleron is static purely magnetic object The name in Greek means “ready to fall” (Klinkhamer and Manton) Sphaleron path consists of conﬁgurations Which are minima in all directions in Hilbert space except one Like streams going from mountain tops to the bottom of the valleyWe do have analytic results for All of them In pure gauge theory Which is not widely knownSphaleron Explosioninstanton-sphaleron processFig. 5.11.3 The “topological landscape”: minimal potentialenergy Umin (in units of1/g2ρ) versus the Chern-Simons num-ber NCS.

The terminology and arrows are described in the text.
this barrier in parametric formUmin(κ,ρ) = (1 −κ2)2 3π2g2ρ,NCS(κ) = 14sign(κ)(1 −|κ|)2(2 + |κ|) . (5.11.4)Here κ = 0 corresponds to the top of the barrier: thisconfiguration is called the “sphaleron” (which in Greekmeans “ready to fall”). It is a solution of the classicalequations of motion, a magnetic ball in which field linesof ⃗Ba (a= 1,2,3 since it is restricted to the SU(2) sub-group of SU(3)) rotate around thex,y,z axes. Since itcorresponds to an energy maximum (rather than mini-mum), a small perturbation would force it to fall downthe barrier profile: this process (also studied analyti-cally and numerically) is called “the sphaleron explo-sion”. (We indicated it on the right side of Fig.5.11.3by red downward arrow.)Sphalerons were originally discovered in electroweaktheory [1365, 1366]: in this case the sphaleron energyis very large, about 8 TeV. There were long debateswhether those can be produced at LHC or future col-liders: so far not a single event of this kind has beenobserved. Production of sphaleron-like hadronic clus-ters with various sizes and masses, in pp collisions atRHIC and LHC, are under consideration, see more inreview [1367]. Green arrows on the r.h.s. of Fig.5.11.3indicate the instanton-sphaleron process in which vac-uum is excited to a “turning point” magnetic configu-ration at the side of the barrier, from which it explodes(rolls downward).
Quantum mechanics allows potential barriers to bepenetrable due to “tunneling”. So, at any energy, evenzero,tunneling events occur,changing NCS spontaneously.
Under the barrier the potentialenergy is larger than thetotal, and the kinetic energy is negativeE−U = K <0.
Since it is proportional to momentum squaredK ∼π2,the motion should occur with imaginary momentum.
That lead to the idea to describe this motion in imag-inary time τ = it, or Euclidean space-time. Explicitsolutions describing tunneling have been found [1350],and are known as the BPSTinstantons (indicated bythe horizontal blue line on the left of Fig.5.11.3). To5.11 Color confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and gauge topology 189find them one assumes the solution is spherically sym-metric in 4-d, and can be described by scalar trial radialfunction f, withgAaµ = ηaµν∂νF(y), F(y) = 2∫ ξ(y)0dξ′f(ξ′) (5.11.5)with ξ = ln(x2/ρ2)and η the ’t Hooft symbol definedbyηaµν =ϵaµν µ, ν= 1, 2, 3,δaµ ν = 4,−δaν µ= 4.
(5.11.6)We also define ηaµν by changing the sign of the lasttwo equations. Putting this expression into the gaugeLagrangian one finds that it takes the formLeﬀ =∫dξ[ ˙f22 + 2f2(1 −f)2](5.11.7)where the dot is the derivative with respect toξ. Thiscorresponds to the motion of a particle in a double-well potential. Note that, sinceL= K−U, the sign infront of the potential isinverted, giving two maximarather than minima. The instanton solution is the one“sliding” from one maximum, atξ = 0, to the other atξ= 1.
As an individual instanton is basically a 4d ball ofGaµν fields, the gauge field vacuum (in Euclidean time)can be described by an ensemble of instantons and an-tiinstantons (those with¯ηaµν). The so called instantonliquid model (ILM) [1368] concluded that the instantonsize and densityρ= 13 fm, n I+¯I = 1R4 = 1 fm −4 (5.11.8)led to chiral symmetry breaking, reproducing parame-ters of chiral perturbation theory and pion properties.
Note that the 4d ball volume isπ2ρ4/2, and the di-luteness nI+¯I π2ρ4/2 ∼1/20 ≪1 of the ensemble isquite small. Yet, they are interacting with each otherstrongly, thus the use of the word “liquid” in the name.
Many years later, numerical simulations on the latticehave shown what it looks like, see Fig.5.11.4 from [1369]. Technically, this is a lattice gauge field “deeply cooled”(with the action minimized) which removes gluons butkeeps the gauge topology intact. One can find more onlattice topology in section4.3.2.
5.11.5 Instantons bind quarks, and by this gen-erates chiral dynamicsG. ‘t Hooft [1370] has found that instantons bind mass-less fermions at zero energy. Technically, these are solu-tions of the Dirac equation in the instanton field, calledFig. 5.11.4 QCD lattice configuration under “deep cooling”:blue and yellow regions are locations of instantons and anti-instantons. One can also see a few magnetic flux tubes.
femionic zero modes . The Pauli principle applies, andeach instanton (a gauge field ball) binds one of eachlight quark,u,d,s . Therefore an “instanton liquid” con-tains “collectivized” light quark states. It is analogoustoaensembleofatoms:whileeachhasitsownelectrons,at a finite density of atoms, these electrons can be indifferent phases, e.g. ”insulating” or “conducting,” de-pending on whether collective electron states do or donot have nonzero density of states on the Fermi surface.
Similarly, an ensemble of instantons can have a spec-trum of Dirac eigenvaluesλ, either with or without agap at λ = 0 : in the latter case (analogous to a con-ductor) the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken.
With the ILM parameters mentioned above, one canprove that this is indeed the case in the QCD vac-uum, and in fact it correctly reproduces the densityof Dirac eigenvalues at zero (proportional to “vacuumquark condensate”) ⟨¯qq⟩≈− (240 MeV )3 known fromphenomenology.
This physics can be described in different, simplerterms. Massless quark fields in QCD have left and right-polarized components which, according to the QCD La-grangian, have independent flavor symmetries. Yet, asquarks get dressed by nontrivial vacuum fields theymay get mixed together so that the quarks developnonzero “constituent quark masses” Meﬀ ∼ 350-400MeV. The nucleon mass is about 3Meﬀ: so the phe-nomenonofchiralsymmetrybreakingexplainsthe“mys-tery of our mass”.
Furthermore, gauge theory in Euclidean time cannaturally describe the properties at finite temperatureT: just define τ to be on a circle with a circumfer-ence ℏ/T (known as Matsubara time). Then the in-stanton solution can easily be made periodic. Although190 5 APPROXIMATE QCDzero fermionic modes are still there at anyT, the spec-trum changes atT >Tχ and the Dirac eigenvalue spec-trum contains a nonzero gap, and chiral symmetry getsunbroken at highT. For a review on the chiral dynam-ics induced by an interacting ensemble of instantonssee [1371].
5.11.6 QCD correlation functions: from quarksto mesons and baryonsPhysicsofQCDcorrelationfunctionsusingthesocalledQCD sum rule method and lattice numerical simula-tions is described in other sections. For a general ped-agogical review see e.g. Ref. [1372]. At small distancesbetween the operators the natural description is pro-vided by perturbative diagrams, defined in terms ofquarksandgluons.Atlargedistancestheyaredescribedin terms of the lowest hadrons with appropriate quan-tum numbers.
Of great interest however is their behavior at inter-mediate distances, at which a transition from one lan-guagetoanothertakesplace.AssummarizedinRef.[ 1372],using diagrams with asingle instanton one can explainthe scale of this transition in “problematic” channels.
In particular, it is attraction in the pion channel andrepulsion inη′, attraction for scalar glueball and repul-sion for pseudoscalar one, etc.
Furthermore,experimentallyknowncorrelationfunc-tions were quantitatively reproduced by the interactinginstanton liquid model even at large distances, first formany mesonic channels [1373, 1374] and subsequentlyfor baryonic correlators [1375]. As a result, the predic-tive power of the model has been explored in substan-tialdepth.Manyofthecouplingconstantsandhadronicmasses were calculated, with good agreement with ex-periment and lattice. (This was shown to be the case, inspite of the fact that instanton models didnot explainconfinement.)Subsequentcalculationsofbaryoniccorrelators[ 1375]have revealed further surprising facts. In the instantonvacuum the nucleon was shown to be made of a “con-stituent quark” plus a deeply bounddiquark, with amass nearly the same as that of constituent quarks. Onthe other hand, decuplet baryons (like∆++) had shownno such diquarks, remaining weakly bound set of threeconstituent quarks. To my knowledge, this was the firstdynamical explanation of deeply bound scalar diquarks.
Deeply bound scalar diquarks are a direct consequenceof the ‘t Hooft Lagrangian, a mechanism that is alsoshared by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio interaction [1376],but ignored for a long time. This subsequently lead tothe realization that diquarks can become Cooper pairsin dense quark matter; see [1377] for a review on “colorsuperconductivity”.
5.11.7 instanton - dyons lead to semiclassical the-ory of the deconfinement and chiral tran-sitionsWehavedescribed monopolesandinstantons,andhaveshown how they can help us understand such importantnonpertubative properties as confinement and chiralsymmetry breaking , respectively. Yet neither of themwere able to describe both of them in a natural way.
This was achieved only during the last decade, us-ing what are calledinstanton−dyons (kind of a hy-brid of these two topological animals, also known asinstanton-monopoles). Technically, if they are far fromeach other, they can be described as monopoles, whichuse theA0 component of the gauge field instead of theadjoint scalar of the Georgi-Glashow model, involved in’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole construction. When theyoverlap, they can still be followed analytically. Whentheir centers happen to be at the same spatial point,their superposition turns out to be nothing else but thewell known instanton [1352, 1378]!A hybrid often inherits good properties of both par-ents – but maybe some bad properties as well. In orderto sort these out, we need to start explaining from spe-cial role ofA0 in the finite-temperature theory. We havementioned that finite temperature theory is defined ona circle τ ∈C1 with the Matsubara period. In suchcases there exist a phenomenon known in mathemat-ics as “holonomy”: there are non-contractable contours.
The so calledPolyakov lineP = Pexp[i∫CdτAa0Ta](5.11.9)(Ta is a color generator) is a gauge invariant opera-tor. (BecauseA0 must be periodic on (Euclidean timecircle) C1, its gauge factors cancel out.) Therefore, ifit has certain values, it cannot be undone and thus,at finite T, one cannot use the A0 = 0 gauge. Andindeed, the average ofP has some well defined expec-tation value⟨P(T)⟩, extensively studied on the lattice(see Fig.5.11.5). Since it is a unitarySU(3) matrix, itcan be defined by three eigenvaluesexp(iµi),i = 1,2,3.
The phases µi are called holonomies µi(T): they pre-scribe the magnitude of the fields Aa0(T). Physically⟨P(T)⟩∼ exp[−FQ/T] is related to the free energy of astatic quark: in the confining phase the latter is infiniteand ⟨P(T)⟩= 0 while in quark-gluon plasma phase itis finite and⟨P(T)⟩̸= 0: so it is theorder parameter ofdeconfinement.5.11 Color confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and gauge topology 191Fig. 5.11.5 Temperature dependence of the mean Polyakovline in pure SU(3) gauge theory, from lattice and instanton-dyon statistical simulations, displays a clear first order phasetransition in which⟨P⟩ jumps from zero belowTc to a finitevalue in the quark-gluon plasma phase at highT.
Recognizing that A0 may have a nonzero constantvalue all over the system, which cannot be gauged awayand is thus physical, one has to look for solutions ofthe YM equations at finite temperatures which at dis-tance ⃗ r→∞ go to such values ofA0. (Rather compli-cated) solutios of this type [1352] for instantons werefound, and it was recognized (only after its actionswere plotted) that it describes a continuous deforma-tion, from one spherical instanton intoNc independentbumps. If Nc = 3 , one can follow how the triplet ofinstanton−dyons is born!Now let us summarize their properties. Like instan-tons, they are (anti) selfdual⃗E = ±⃗B and live in Eu-clidean space time. So, they are not really particles,since they do not exist in the Minkowski world. Likeinstantons, they have nonzero topological chargesQ∼∫d4x( ⃗E·⃗B). Unlike instantons, however, those chargesare not quantized to integers : Qi,i = 1 ,2,3 can takeany values, except that their sum is still|∑31 Qi|= 1 .
These Qi (equal to their actionsSi) are proportionalto differences νi = µi+1 −µi of the eigenvalues of thePolyakov line (the holonomies). So,Si = νiS where thecoefficient is the “instanton action”S = 8π2g(T)2 =(113 Nc −23Nf)log( TΛQCD)Non-integer Qi is only possible because they inher-itedpropertiesofanotherparent,themagneticmonopoles.
These objects are connected by Dirac strings (this con-nection undoes the topological classification theoremswhich require that the fields be smooth at infinities.)They are called “dyons” because a magnetic charge plusa selfduality implies also presence of anelectric charge(although real only in the Eucldean world and thus notquite physical).
Before we can proceed, we need to clarify one morepuzzle related to fermionic zero modes of instanton -dyons . An instanton hasonefermionic zero mode, andif it gets split into three instanton - dyons , one may askhow this zero mode be shared between them. The an-swer, also due to van Baal and collaborators, is that thezero mode is centered nearone of the three : which onedepends on the interrelation between holonomy phasesµi and quark periodicity phases calledzf where indexf means flavor,u,d,s... . Further details on instanton-dyons, their interaction and fermionic zero modes canbe found in references mentioned.
This information should be sufficient to understandhow one can “hunt” for these objects on the lattice.
One method is “cooling” of vacuum fields, like that usedin Fig.5.11.4. Better still is “constrained minimization”[1379] preserving the value of⟨P⟩: it revealed selfdualclusters of topological charges which integrate to non-integer values. But the best is the “fermionic filter”,developed by Gattringer et. al. and Ilgenfritz et. al. ,based on the zero modes of the quark Dirac operator.
In Fig.5.11.6 we show an example from [1380, 1381]in which it was used. QCD simulations with realisticmasses, performed by large collaborations on super-computers, provide a set of configurations to these au-thors. These calculations are especially expensive sincethey use the so called domain wall fermions provid-ing very accurate chiral symmetry of lattice fermions.
Yet Larsen et. al. used even better ones, calledover-lap fermions , for which chiral symmetry is exact evenfor finite lattices (without the continuum limita →0taken). Those possessexactzero modesλ= 0 and con-figurations have exactly integer topological charges.
Fig.5.11.6showsatypicallandscapeofthezeromodedensities |ψ0(x)|2 in two spatial dimensions. Red, blueand green colors show those for three different fermionicperiodicity phases, identifying three instanton - dyontypes (forNc = 3) that they want to locate. The peakscorrespond to locations and sizes of the individual zeromodes in these field configurations. One can be con-vinced that the peaks are instanton - dyons becausetheir shapes are well described by analytic formulae asderived by van Baal and collaborators, within a fewpercent accuracy. Furthermore, this is true not only forwell separated ones, but also for overlapping ones! Thegauge field configurations are forT a little bit abovedeconfinement Tc, in a quark-gluon plasma possessing192 5 APPROXIMATE QCDzillions of thermal quarks and gluons: and yet, the in-stanton - dyons are apparently undisturbed by them!(For clarity: we do not mean here the values of thetopological charge Qor number of zero modes , protectedby certain mathematical theorems. The observed space-time shapes of the Dirac eigenmodes are not protectedby any theorems known to us.)Previousworkshoweverhavenotanalyzedthe“topo-logical clusters”, the situations in which two or threedyons overlap strongly. The Kraan-van Baal solutionallows to study these cases, and good agreement wasalso found in the numerical analysis of instanton-dyonensembles in [1380, 1381]. The semiclassical descrip-tio of zero and near-zero Dirac modes on the latticeis quite accurate, at least in terms of the zero modeshapes. While the very existence of zero modes was re-quired by topological theorems, good correspondence oftheir shapes (in physical thermal vacuum versus puresemiclassical dyons) was a good unexpected news.
This (and many similar plots) extracted from simu-lations of the QCD vacuum should convince the readerthat instanton - dyons are well identified objects, interms of which one can try to describe the underlyinggauge field configurations. If so, perhaps a dream beingalive for half a century since 1970’s to develop consi-tent semiclassical theory of deconfinement and chiraltransitions can still be realized.
Following this idea, ensembles of instanton - dyonswere studied by a number of methods, including themean field (solving certain “gap equations”) or straight-forwardstatisticalMonte-Carlosimulations.Thosewereperformed first for the SU(2) gauge theory [1382], thenfor the SU(3) [366], first without dynamical fermions,5FIG. 6: ⇢ ( x, y ) of the zero mode of conf. 2960 at   = ⇡ (lefttop), ⇡ / 3 (right top) and   ⇡ / 3( b o t t o m ) . T =1 . 08 T c .
All of the ⇢ ( x, t ) plots also look very similar due to all3 peaks being very close to each other (around 1 latticespacing). We therefore just show one of them. See ﬁg. 7.

If we make a integration around the dominating peakwe ﬁnd a contribution of the overall normalization of size0 . 74. Thus, even though it is dominating, other smallcontributions also exist, which end up contributing a sub-stantial part.
The peak is also not symmetric around the maximum.
This indicates that the other dyons are sitting on one sideof the dyon. How much we can get the two sides to be-have di ↵ erently depends on the Polyakov loop, throughthe angles µ i . This is a good way to exclude a stan-dard(deconﬁning) instanton as shown in ﬁg 8.

The picture is consistent in all the conﬁgurations ex-plored. Below we show another conﬁguration for the an-gle   = ⇡ / 3. This is for a conﬁguration di ↵ erent from allthe previous ones. This is mostly to show that the pictureis consistent through many di ↵ erent conﬁgurations.
We show the ⇢ ( x, y ) and ⇢ ( x, t ) plot for the lattice re-sults in ﬁg. 9 and 11 which we compare to the analyticsolution in ﬁg. 10 and 12.

Focusing now on another conﬁguration at the sametemperature, we can at the angle   = ⇡ see a strongindication that the value of the holonomy µ i should beconﬁning (o ↵ course the values can ﬂuctuate from con-ﬁguration to conﬁguration).

B. T =1 . 08 T cWhen we use the overlap operator using anti periodicboundary conditions at T =1 . 08 T c , we ﬁnd a singlestrong peak for conﬁgurations with Q top = ± 1. Thisdoes not mean that there is only one topological objectin the system. It shows that there is one which is notstrongly a ↵ ected by opposite type of topological objects,such that it dominates the contribution to the zero mode.
This is not the case when we start to turn the bound-ary condition to other values. We look at the angles  = ⇡ , ⇡ / 3 ,   ⇡ / 3. In the conﬁned phase, these valuescorrespond to one sector each, and has the largest dis-tance to the angles of the Polyakov loop µ i . We show anexample of ⇢ ( x, y ) at these 3 angles in ﬁg. 6.
We found that their ﬁelds interfere with each other the interaction between themIs in excellent agreement with van Baal analytic formulae ⌧7FIG. 14: ⇢ ( x, y ) of the zero mode of conf. 2540 at T =1 . 08 T c .

Other cases overlap much stronger like in ﬁg. 15.
When one do the ﬁts though, this case ﬁts very well withdyons at a distance around 0 . 14 (around one lattice spac-ing), which is close but not overlapping completely. Alsowhen dyons are close in analytic solutions, the peak of thedensity can, dependent on the dyons position, be shiftedslightly to the side.
At T = T c in ﬁg. 16 and 17 we observe more peakswhich overlap with each other (atleast after summingover t), and we still observe that the dyons don’t alwayssit on top of each other. Also it appears that the typicaldistance is larger, though this need more statistics.

VII. STRONG OVERLAPIn some cases we observe several peaks to be overlap-ping with each other strongly. In these cases one wouldmost likely need a Q top = N solution to ﬁt the behaviorcompletely. Still if we do our 2d slices such that the sliceis dominated by 1 of the several peaks, we can still ob-tain a behavior similar to that of the Q top = 1. We showan example of this where we in ﬁg. 18 show the density⇢ ( x, y ) and the density ⇢ ( x, t ) in ﬁg. 19 and 20. While wecan see the other peaks in the ⇢ ( x, t ) plots, they are nottoo large. We compare the ⇢ ( x, t ) plots to the analyticformula in ﬁg. 21 and 22, which has been chosen suchthat they resemble the lattice results.

thenwiththem[ 1383,1384].InFig. 5.11.5wehaveshownone example of a comparison between a semiclassicalinstanton-dyon ensemble and lattice simulations. Wecannot present here other results of these works butjust state that they compare well with the locationand properties of QCD phase transitions which we nowknow from lattice simulations. Note that those workswere done on laptops or ordinary PCs, not supercom-puters, and yet the number of topological objects inthem are counted by hundreds, while very expensivelattice simulations have only few of them (as one cansee from the example above).
Furthermore, in such studies people used not justQCD, but also two types of “QCD deformations”. OneofthemaddsextraoperatorswithpowersofthePolyakovline to the gauge action. By changing their strength onecan affect the location and strength of the deconfine-ment phase transition. Another type of QCD deforma-tion makes quarks obeying modified periodicity condi-tion on the Matsubara circle, making quark statisticsto be intermediate between fermions and bosons. Thisdeformation affects the location and strength of the chi-ral phase transition. What these deformations tell us isthat these two phase transitions should not genericallybe coincident, as they are in QCD. Again, one can ap-ply such deformations on the lattice or in the instanton- dyon semiclassical theory, and compare the results. Sofar, the agreement between them is quite good, whichis encouraging.
5.11.8 Conclusions and discussionThe main thrust of this section is to convince the readerthat topological solitons play an important role in theunderstanding of such nonperturbative phenomena inQCD as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking invacuum, as well asdeconfinement and chiral symme-try restoration at high temperatures. A wider view onthat should include thedeformed versions of QCD, oreven other gauge theories, electroweak or supersymmet-ric theories.
It would be nice to have justonetype of those: butin fact the history of the field we followed in this sec-tion included (at least) three:the particle-monopoles,instantons and instanton - dyons . All of those werefound on the lattice, by different “filters”, and wereshown to be strongly correlated with certain physicalphenomena we would like to understand.
