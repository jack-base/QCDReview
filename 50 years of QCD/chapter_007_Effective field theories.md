193Theinstantonshavefermioniccloudsboundtothem,and their “collectivization” into a “conductor” withouta gap explains how a “quark condensate” is formed,the physics of massless pions, and (unlike earlier theo-ries) whyη′ is so heavy. They explain the value of the“constituent quark mass” as well as that of the nucleon(and thus ourselves). While instanton ensembles do notexplain confinement, they do have most of the lowestmesonsandbaryons(nucleonincluded)asboundstates.
The instanton−dyons (being a hybrid of the firsttwo) connect topology with holonomy (the Polyakovline, or nonzeroA0 VEV, in Euclidean formulation) ina way, which produces a nice semiclassical theory ofboth deconfinement and chiral transition. It was shownto work quantitatively, not only for QCD, but for itsdeformations as well.
Taken together, those facts and observations are im-pressive. The reader is reminded that they constitutethe result of five decades of work by multiple theorists.
But still, the reader is perhaps a bit confused by thevery richness of the story told. One would probablyprefer a simpler and more uniform picture.
Such feelings are shared by some active participantsin this process, and some light at the end of the tunnelis, in fact, now showing. At the end of the section, letus briefly describe these later developments.
It started with Ref. [1385], using the well controlledsetting of the most-supersymmetric gauge theory, withN=4 supersymmetries. This theory has adjoint scalarsand ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopoles as classical solutions,and the partition function in terms of these monopolescan be calculated. The same theory in aR3C1 setting(preserving supersymmetries) also has holonomies andinstanton - dyons, and the partition function writtenin terms of these was calculated as well. The two ex-pressions are completely different, one better convergesat small and another at large radius of the circleC1.
Nevertheless, as Doreyet. al. observed, using Poissonsummation formula, both producethe same answer forthe statistical sum! This unexpected result was called“the Poisson duality”. The importance of this paper wasnot noticed promptly. Indeed, such duality is very non-trivial: it is enough to remember that monopoles areparticles moving in Minkowskian space-times, while in-stanton - dyons can only be defined in Euclidean pe-riodic formulation. And yet, they apparently describethe same dynamics!In fact this phenomenon has nothing to do withsupersymmetry or gauge theories, and is present in amuch broader domain. In Ref. [1386], the existence ofthePoisson duality wasdemonstratedforasimplequan-tum mechanical rotator. The duality means that a par-tition sum can either be written using Hamiltonian andstationary states, or using Lagrangian and periodic Eu-clidean paths. Further elucidation of this duality re-garding QCD monopoles [1386] shed light on their den-sity and the long-known absence of classical solutionsfor them. All of these hint that the different faces of“gauge topology” we discussed will “asymptotically”converge into a single semiclassical theory.
6 Effective field theoriesConveners:F ranz Gross and Mike StricklandIn this second section on approximate methods, we dis-cuss effective field theories (EFTs), a powerful tech-nique that can be used when there are widely sepa-rated energy scales appearing in a problem. A clas-sic example of this is non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD),which emerges in the limit of a large quark massM(Sec. 6.1). Forv = p/M ≪1, there is a large separa-tion between ‘hard’ modes, with energy on the order ofM; soft modes, with energy on the order ofMv; andulrasoft (potential) modes, with energy/momentum onthe orderMv2. Using EFT methods, one can write aneffective NRQCD Lagrangian that includes all terms al-lowed by QCD symmetries. The coefficients in this ef-fectiveLagrangiancanbecomputedsystematicallybyamatching procedure, which ensures that quantities cal-culated in the EFT are the same as those computed inQCD itself up to a given order inv. The NRQCD EFTcanbeextendedbyfurtherintegratingoutthesoftscaleto obtain an effective theory called potential NRQCD(pNRQCD), which is written entirely in terms of singletand octet quark-antiquark pairs. As a result, at leadingorder in pNRQCD, the physics of heavy quarkonium re-duces to solving a Schrödinger equation for bound statewave functions.
This is but one example. The use of EFTs applied toQCD has allowed systematic progress on many fronts inthe last decades. These include a systematically extend-able model of low-energy hadronic physics called chiralperturbation theory (Sec. 6.2), which can be used as afoundation for nuclear physcs (Sec. 6.3) giving both asuccessful description of the NN interaction up to 200MeV, and the properties of light nuclei up toA ≤12.
In the realm of jets, soft-collinear effective theory im-plements power counting in the transverse momentumof gluon radiation (Sec. 6.4).
EFT methods have also been used to understandhigh-temperature QCD thermodynamics, in which casethe hard, soft, and ultrasoft scales areT, gT, andg2T,respectively (Sec. 6.5). The resulting EFTs, called elec-trostaticQCD(EQCD)andmagnetostaticQCD(MQCD)194 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESallow one to systematically calculate the equation ofstate of a high-temperature quark-gluon plasma.

6.1 Nonrelativistic effective theoryAntonio V airoIn QCD, quarks may be divided into two fundamentalsets: heavy quarks (charm, bottom, top) whose massesmh are much larger than the typical hadronic scaleΛQCD andlightquarks(up,down,strange)whosemassesmℓ are much smaller thanΛQCD. Both the hierarchies,mh ≫ΛQCD and mℓ ≪ΛQCD, allow for an effectivefield theory (EFT) treatment of hadrons that exploitsthe symmetries that the hadrons manifest in the largeand small mass limits. Because these symmetries arenot manifest in QCD, the EFT is typically simpler andmorepredictivethanthefullQCDtreatment,atleastatthe lowest orders in the effective expansion. At higherorders in the effective expansion the original symme-tries of QCD are restored. We discuss EFTs for heavyquarks in this section, while EFTs for light quarks, i.e.,chiral EFTs, are reviewed in the following sections.
In general, an effective field theory of QCD is con-structed as an expansion in the ratioΛℓ/Λh of a lowenergy scale Λℓ, e.g. ΛQCD, and a high energy scaleΛh, e.g. mh. Each term in the expansion is made ofthe fields describing the system at the low-energy scale;thesetermsmayhaveanyformconsistentwiththesym-metries of QCD. The low-energy fields are the effectivedegrees of freedom. The resulting scattering matrix isthemostgeneraloneconsistentwithanalyticity,pertur-bative unitarity, cluster decomposition and the symme-try principles [1387].
It is said that the large energy scale “has been inte-grated out” from QCD. Analytic terms in the expansionparameter Λℓ/Λh are accounted for by the operatorsof the EFT. Non-analytic terms, carrying the contri-butions of the high-energy modes in QCD, which areno longer dynamical in the EFT, are encoded in theparameters multiplying the EFT operators. These pa-rameters are the Wilson coefficients of the EFT, alsocalled matching coefficients, or low-energy constants inthe chiral EFT. Hence, EFTs automatically factorize,for any observable, high-energy from low-energy contri-butions. The Wilson coefficients of the EFT Lagrangianarefixedbymatchingtothefundamentaltheory,i.e.,byrequiring that the EFT and the fundamental theory de-scribe the same physics (observables, Green functions,scattering matrices, ...) at any given order in the ex-pansion parameterΛℓ/Λh.
The advantage of dealing with heavy quarks is thatthe matching coefficients associated with the heavy qu-ark mass scale are guaranteed to be computable in per-turbative QCD, i.e., order by order in αs(mh), as aconsequence of asymptotic freedom. This is not the casefor matching coefficients associated with lower energyscales or for the low-energy constants that need to becomputed either numerically in lattice QCD or fixed onexperimental data.
To allow for controlled calculations based on the ef-fective Lagrangian, operators, as well as the quantumcorrections, are organized according to their expectedimportance. Operators in the Lagrangian are countedin powers of the small expansion parameter Λℓ/Λh,whereas quantum corrections are either computed ex-actly or counted in powers of the coupling constant. Forexample, a strict expansion in terms of the coupling ispossible, as remarked above, when integrating out theheavy quark mass.
EFTs are renormalizable at each order in the expan-sion parameter. Hence, the EFT produces finite andcontrolled expansions for any observable of the effec-tive degrees of freedom that may be computed respect-ing the energy scale hierarchy upon which the EFT isbased. The power counting of the EFT, i.e., the wayto assess the size of the different terms in the effec-tive expansion, may or may not be obvious. The powercounting turns out to be obvious if the system is char-acterized by just one dynamical energy scale. Reducingthe description of a system to that one of an effectiveone scale system is the ultimate goal of any effectivefield theory.
In this section, we restrict ourself to EFTs for heavyquarks, where the heavy quark mass is the largest scale.
These EFTs are called nonrelativistic EFTs, because re-quiring the heavy quark mass to be the largest scale im-plies that it is also larger than the momentump of theheavy quark in the hadron reference frame: the con-dition mh ≫p qualifies the quark as nonrelativistic.
The presentation of this section follows the one of Ref.
[1388].
For hadrons made of one heavy quark, like heavy-light mesons and baryons, the proper nonrelativisticEFT is called Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET).
Heavy-light hadrons are systems characterized by justtwo relevant energy scales,mh and ΛQCD. HQET fol-6.1 Nonrelativistic effective theory 195lows from QCD by integrating out modes associatedwith the heavy quark mass and exploiting the hierar-chy mh ≫ΛQCD. In the context of HQET one dealswith heavy-light hadrons made of either a charm or abottom quark (the top quark has no time to form abound state before decaying weakly into a b quark).
HQET is discussed in section6.1.1.
Systems made of more than one heavy quark, likequarkonia(e.g.charmoniumandbottomonium)orquar-konium-like states or doubly-heavy baryons are char-acterized by more energy scales. The typical distancebetween the heavy quarks is of the order of1/(mhv),v ≪1 being the relative velocity of the heavy quark,which implies that the typical momentum transfer be-tween the heavy quarks is of ordermhv, and the typ-ical binding and kinetic energy is of ordermhv2. Theinverse ofmhv2 sets the time scale of the bound state.
These systems are to some extent the QCD equivalentof positronium in QED. In a positronium, an electronand a positron move with a relative velocityv ∼α,where α is the fine structure constant, at a typical dis-tance given by the Bohr radius, which is proportionalto 1/(mα), and are bound with the energy given by theBohr levels, which are proportional tomα2.
At each of the energy scales one can construct anEFT,specifically,nonrelativisticQCD(NRQCD)atthescale mhv, which is discussed in Sec.6.1.2, and poten-tial NRQCD (pNRQCD) at the scalemhv2, which isdiscussed in Sec.6.1.3.
6.1.1 Heavy Quark Effective TheoryHeavy Quark Effective Theory was the first nonrela-tivistic EFT of QCD with a fully developed nonrela-tivistic expansion, computation of higher-order radia-tive corrections, renormalization group equations, anda wide range of physical applications [667, 1051, 1252,1389] (for an early review see, for instance, Ref. [1390],for a textbook see Ref. [674]). This despite the fact thatnonrelativistic QCD and QED, the EFTs for two non-relativistic particles that we discuss in section 6.1.2,were suggested before [1391].
In a sense, HQET describes QCD in the oppositelimit of the chiral EFT, however, it is important torealize that HQET is not the large mass limit of QCD,buttheEFTsuitedtodescribeheavy-lighthadrons,i.e.,hadrons made of one heavy particle and light degreesof freedom. The heavy particle may be taken to be aheavy quark, but also a composite particle made bymore than one heavy quark when the internal modes ofthe composite heavy particle can be ignored. The lightdegrees of freedom are made by light quarks and gluons.
Among the light quarks we may distinguish betweenvalence quarks and sea quarks, where the first ones arethose that establish, together with the heavy degreesof freedom, the quantum numbers of the heavy-lighthadron.
The HQET Lagrangian is made of low-energy de-grees of freedom living at the low-energy scaleΛQCD.
These are the low-energy modes of the heavy quark(antiquark), described by a Pauli spinor ψ (χ) thatannihilates (creates) the heavy quark (antiquark), andlow-energy gluons and light quarks. The HQET is con-structed as an expansion in1/mh: the heavy quark ex-pansion. Matrix elements of operators of dimensiondare of orderΛdQCD, hence the higher the dimension ofthe operator the higher the suppression inΛQCD/mh.
In the rest frame of the heavy-light hadron, the HQETLagrangian density for a heavy quark reads up to order1/m2h and including the1/m3h kinetic operator (HQETup to order1/m4h can be found in Refs. [1392, 1393])LHQET =Lψ + Lℓ, (6.1.1)withLψ =ψ†{iD0 + D22mh+ D48m3h−cFσ ·gB2mh−cD[D·,gE]8m2h−icSσ ·[D×,gE]8m2h}ψ,(6.1.2)Lℓ = −14FAµνFAµν + d2m2hFAµνD2FAµν− d3m2hgfABCFAµνFBµαFCνα+nℓ∑ℓ=1¯qℓ(i/D−mℓ)qℓ, (6.1.3)where [D·,gE] = D ·gE −gE ·D and [D×,gE] =D ×gE −gE ×D, Ei = Fi0 is the chromoelectricfield, Bi = −ϵijkFjk/2 the chromomagnetic field, andσ arethePaulimatrices.Thefields qℓ arenℓ light-quarkfields. The heavy-quark mass,mh, has to be understoodastheheavyquarkpolemass,hencenotthemassthatisin the QCD Lagrangian. The coefficientscF, cD, cS, d2,and d3 are Wilson coefficients of the EFT. They encodethe contributions of the high-energy modes that havebeen integrated out from QCD. Since the high-energyscale, mh, is larger thanΛQCD, the Wilson coefficientsmay be computed in perturbation theory and organizedas an expansion inαs at a typical scale of ordermh.
The coefficientscF, cD, andcS are 1 at leading order,while the perturbative series of the coefficientsd2 andd3 starts at order αs. The one-loop expression of thecoefficients may be found in Ref. [1394]. Some of the co-efficients are known far beyond one loop. For instance,196 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESthe Fermi coefficientcF, which plays a crucial role inthe spin splittings, is known up to three loops [1395].
In Eq. (6.1.3) we have not considered1/m2h suppressedoperators involving light quarks [1396, 1397] since theirimpact is negligible in most hadronic observables. TheHQET Lagrangian for a heavy antiquark may be ob-tained from Eqs. (6.1.1) and (6.1.2) by charge conjuga-tion.
The HQET Lagrangian provides a description ofheavy-light hadrons that is the same as QCD order byorder inΛQCD/mh. Because QCD is a Lorentz invarianttheory, this symmetry must be somehow maintained inHQET, although HQET breaks manifest Lorentz in-variance by the nonrelativistic expansion. Indeed, Lor-entz invariance is realized in HQET by constrainingthe Wilson coefficients [1394, 1398–1400]. For instance,Lorentz invariance relatescF and the spin-orbit coef-ficient cS: cS = 2 cF −1. This relation is exact, whichmeans that it holds to any order inαs.
TheimpactofHQETonthephysicsinvolvingheavy-light hadrons and, in particular, their weak decays hasbeen enormous. The reason is that the leading-orderHQET Lagrangian,L(0)HQET = ψ†iD0ψ−14FAµνFAµν +nℓ∑ℓ=1¯qℓ(i/D−mℓ)qℓ,(6.1.4)makes manifest a hidden symmetry of heavy-light had-rons. This symmetry is the heavy-quark symmetry andstands for invariance with respect to the heavy-quarkflavor and spin. A consequence of the heavy-quark sym-metry is that electroweak transitions in the heavy-lightmesonsectordependononlyoneformfactor,theIsgur–Wise functionξ(w), whose absolute normalization isξ(0) = 1 [1252, 1389]. Moreover, the leading-orderHQET Lagrangian is exactly renormalizable.
Higher-orderoperatorsinEq.( 6.1.1)breaktheheavy-quark symmetry (and exact renormalizability), how-ever, they do it in a perturbative way controlled bypowers ofΛQCD/mh. Hence, observables computed upto some order in the HQET expansion depend on fewerand more universal nonperturbative matrix elementsthan they would in a full QCD calculation. This makesthe heavy quark expansion more predictive than a fullQCD calculation.
As an application, let us consider the heavy-lightmeson masses. Expressed in the HQET as an expansionup to order1/mh, they read [1401]MH(∗) = mh + ¯Λ+ µ2π2mh−dH(∗)µ2G(mh)2mh+ O( 1m2h),(6.1.5)where MH(∗) is the spin singlet (triplet) meson mass,mh the heavy quark pole mass, ¯Λ the binding energyin the static limit, of orderΛQCD, µ2π/2mh the kineticenergy of the heavy quark (µ2π is the matrix elementof ψ†D2ψ), of order Λ2QCD/mh, dH(∗) is 1 for H and−1/3 for H∗, anddH(∗) µ2G(mh)/2mh is the matrix ele-ment ofcF ψ†σ ·gB/(2mh)ψ, of orderΛ2QCD/mh. Theheavy quark symmetry manifests itself through the uni-versality of the leading termMH(∗) −mh ≈ ¯Λ, and ofthe matrix elementsµ2π andµ2G(mh)/cF(mh), which de-pend neitheron the heavyquark flavornor on the heavyquark spin. The flavor dependence ofµ2G(mh) comes en-tirely from the Wilson coefficientcF, which depends onmh through the running of the strong coupling. Equa-tion (6.1.5) can be used to extract the heavy quarkmasses from the measured meson masses. One can alsouse lattice QCD data to determine meson masses forfictitious heavy quarks of any massmh, so to recon-struct MH(∗) as a function ofmh. One general difficultyin this kind of study is that the relation between theMS mass, which is the short distance quantity that ap-pears in the renormalized QCD Lagrangian, and thepole mass, which is the quantity that appears in theHQET Lagrangian, is plagued by a poorly convergentperturbative series (at present, the relation betweenthe MS mass and the pole mass is known up to fourloops [1402, 1403]). The large terms in the perturba-tive series trace back to a renormalon singularity in theBorelplaneoforder ΛQCD.Thissingularitymaybesub-tracted fromthe pole mass and reabsorbed intoa redefi-nition of the other nonperturbative parameters appear-ing in Eq. (6.1.5). There are many possible subtractionschemes [1404–1409]. For illustration, we present theheavy quark masses and matrix elements appearing in(6.1.5)obtainedfromlatticeQCDdatasettoreproducethe physicalDs and Bs masses in Ref. [269]:mc = 1273(10) MeV,mb = 4195(14) MeV,¯Λ= 555(31) MeV,µ2π = 0.05(22) GeV2,µ2G(mb) = 0 .38(2) GeV2,where mh is theMS mass of the quarkhat the scale ofits MS mass, ¯Λis in the renormalon subtraction schemeadopted in Ref. [269, 1409] and the quantity µ2G hasbeen evaluated for theb quark. Note the approximatescaling of the nonperturbative parameters according tothe power counting of HQET (with a somewhat smallerµ2π).
Equation (6.1.5) can be immediately extended toheavy-light baryons. What changes is the explicit valueof the nonperturbative matrix elements, as the light6.1 Nonrelativistic effective theory 197degrees of freedom are different from the mesonic case.
Also doubly-heavy baryons may be described by thesame mass formula if the typical distance between thetwo heavy quarks is much smaller than the typical sizeof a heavy-light meson, which is of order1/ΛQCD. Inthis case, at a distance of order 1/ΛQCD one cannotresolve the inner structure of the heavy diquark sys-tem, which effectively behaves as a pointlike particlein an antitriplet color configuration, i.e., as a heavyantiquark of mass2mh; under some conditions, effectsdue to the heavy quark-quark interaction my be addedperturbatively in the framework of the nonrelativisticEFTs developed in the following sections [761, 1410–1419]. Finally, the heavy quark symmetry may be alsoapplied to link doubly-heavy tetraquarks (tetraquarksmade of two heavy and two light quarks) with heavy-lightbaryonssharingthesamelight-quarkcontent[ 1415,1420,1421].Manyofthenewcharmonium-andbottomonium-like states observed at colliders in the last decades havea doubly-heavy tetraquark content [1388].
6.1.2 Nonrelativistic QCDHadrons made of two or more nonrelativistic particles,like two heavy quarks or a heavy quark and a heavy an-tiquark, or more generally just heavy quark-antiquarkpairs near threshold, are multiscale systems character-ized by a hierarchy of dynamically generated scales:mh ≫mhv≫mhv2. (6.1.6)We discussed the origin of these energy scales at the be-ginning of the section. The nonrelativistic energy scalesare correlated. To reach a situation like in HQET, i.e.
an EFT with just one dynamical low-energy scale, weneed to construct at least two nonrelativistic EFTs: onefollowing from integrating out from QCD modes asso-ciated with the energy scalemh and one following fromintegrating out modes associated with the energy scalemhv, ending up with an ultimate EFT at the energyscale mhv2 [1422]. An illustration of the tower of en-ergy scales and corresponding EFTs is in Fig.6.1.1. Inthe last twenty years, the development of such nonrel-ativistic EFTs of QCD has been the major theoreti-cal breakthrough in the description of quarkonium andquarkonium-like systems [1423–1425]. For a more his-torical perspective, see Ref. [1426].
NRQCDistheEFTsuitedtodescribesystemsmadeof a heavy quark and (anti)quark pair near thresholdthat follows from QCD by integrating out the energyscale associated with the heavy quark mass,mh [1391].
In a heavy quark-antiquark bound state, the virial the-orem constrains the kinetic energy of the heavy par-ticles to be of the same order as the binding energy.
non relativistic scales EFTshhhm v NRQCDpNRQCD2m vm QCDFig. 6.1.1 Hierarchy of energy scales and EFTs for systemsmade of a heavy quark and (anti)quark pair near threshold.
As a consequence, the power counting of NRQCD mustbe such that the leading-order NRQCD Lagrangian in-cludes the kinetic energy operators,ψ† ∇2/(2mh) ψ −χ†∇2/(2mh)χ, making the NRQCD Lagrangian, evenat leading order, non renormalizable. This is differentfrom HQET.
NRQCD posed initially also some difficulties in find-ing a computational scheme to integrate consistentlyover the different momentum and energy regions in di-mensional regularization. NRQCD or its QED equiva-lent were therefore used for a long time either for an-alytical calculations in QED with a hard cut off [1427,1428] or for lattice QCD calculations involving heavyquarks [268, 1429]. The advantage for lattice NRQCDcalculationsisthat,oncetheheavyquarkmasshasbeenintegrated out, the lattice spacing,a, is not constrained,as in full lattice QCD calculations, to be smaller than1/mh, which would amount to requiring a very fine lat-tice if the quark is heavy. In lattice NRQCD the con-straint is relaxed toa <1/(mhv). Since at the sametime the lattice size has to be large enough to includedistances of the order of 1/ΛQCD for quenched cal-culations and 1/Mπ for full calculations, simulationswith heavy quarks in full QCD are computationallyquite demanding. Lattice NRQCD has been, for a longtime, the sole way to compute nonperturbatively ob-servables involving bottom quarks in full QCD (see, forinstance, Refs. [260,1430–1433]). Only recently the firstfull lattice QCD calculations of bottomonium-like sys-tems have become available [1434].
After the development of HQET, NRQCD becamea systematic tool for analytical calculations of quarko-nium observables. NRQCD is well suited to the descrip-tionofheavyquark-antiquarkannihilation,becausethishappens at the scale mh, which is the energy scalethat has been integrated out from QCD to constructNRQCD. In NRQCD, the information about annihi-198 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESlation goes into the (imaginary part) of the Wilsoncoefficients associated with the four-fermion operators.
Thesefourfermionoperators,anovelfeatureofNRQCDwith respect to HQET, are not only essential to thedescription of the annihilation processes, but also tothe correct description of all short-distance interactionsbetween the heavy particles. In NRQCD, annihilationprocesses factorize therefore into a short-distance part,which may be computed in perturbative QCD and isencoded in the Wilson coefficients, and into matrix el-ements of the NRQCD operators that encode the low-energy dynamics of the heavy quark-antiquark boundstate. Processes involving heavy quark-antiquark anni-hilations are quarkonium inclusive and electromagneticdecay [1435, 1436] and quarkonium production [1436].
The large amount of data on quarkonium productionin hadron and lepton colliders, together with the pre-dictive power of NRQCD and its success in most ofthe predictions, has established NRQCD as a standardtool for studying quarkonium annihilation [1423–1425,1437–1439].
Becausefour-fermionoperatorsprojectingontocoloroctet quark-antiquark states are possible, NRQCD nat-urally allows for production and decay of quark-antiqu-ark states in a color octet configuration. These statesconstitute a suppressed, inv, component of the Fockstate describing a physical quarkonium, but are nec-essary in the quarkonium phenomenology [1423–1425].
They are also necessary for the consistency of the the-ory, as they cancel infrared divergences in quarkoniumdecay and production observables and eventually pro-vide finite, physical results [1435, 1436]. It should benoted,however,thattheNRQCDfactorizationhasbeenrigorouslyprovedonlyforquarkoniumdecaybutnotforquarkonium production [1277, 1314, 1440–1442].
A last crucial progress in establishing NRQCD as avaluable tool for analytical calculations came when itwas shown that the computation of the Wilson coeffi-cients of NRQCD in dimensional regularization requiresexpanding in the heavy quark mass to avoid integratingover the high momentum region. This means that, evenif the power countings of NRQCD and HQET are dif-ferent, the matching to QCD proceeds in the same way,leading to the same operators and Wilson coefficientsin the two-fermion and gauge sectors [1394].
The NRQCD Lagrangian density for systems madeof a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark of equal massesmh up to order1/m2h, and including the1/m3h kineticoperator, is given byLNRQCD =Lψ + Lχ + Lψχ + Lℓ, (6.1.7)where Lψ and Lχ are the HQET Lagrangian densitiesfor the quark (see Eq. (6.1.2)) and antiquark, respec-tively,Lℓ is the Lagrangian density (6.1.3) for the lightdegrees of freedom, andLψχ is the four-fermion sector,which up to order1/m2h readsLψχ = f1(1S0)m2hψ†χχ†ψ+ f1(3S1)m2hψ†σχ·χ†σψ+ f8(1S0)m2hψ†TAχχ†TAψ+ f8(3S1)m2hψ†TAσχ·χ†TAσψ.
(6.1.8)As in the HQET case,mh is the pole mass. The four-fermion Lagrangian in Eq. (6.1.8) is made of all possiblefour-fermion operators of dimension 6. The correspond-ing Wilson coefficients are f1(1S0), f1(3S1), f8(1S0),and f8(3S1). The the first (second) four-fermion op-erator projects on a heavy quark-antiquark pair in acolor singlet configuration with quantum numbers1S0(3S1), whereas the third (fourth) four-fermion opera-tor projects on a heavy quark-antiquark pair in a coloroctet configuration with quantum numbers1S0 (3S1).
The matrices TA are the SU(3) generatorsλA/2. Thefour-fermion Wilson coefficients have been computed inRefs. [1436, 1443]. They have a real part that starts atorder αs for f8(3S1) and at orderα2s for the other coef-ficients, and they have an imaginary part, coming fromone loop or higher annihilation diagrams, which is of or-der α2s for Imf1(1S0), Imf8(1S0), and Imf8(3S1), andof orderα3s for Imf1(3S1). A list of imaginary parts offour-fermion Wilson coefficients in NRQCD and relatedbibliography can be found in Ref. [1444].
The four-fermion sector of the NRQCD Lagrangianhas been derived up to order1/m4h (complete) and or-ders1/m5h and1/m6h (partial)inRefs.[ 1445–1447].Likefor the Wilson coefficients in the two-fermion sector,also the coefficients in the four-fermion sector are notall independent: some are related by Poincaré invari-ance [1446, 1447].
Sometimes it is useful to isolate the electromagneticcomponent of the four-fermion operator and its corre-sponding Wilson coefficient. This is the case when com-puting electromagnetic decay widths and photoproduc-tion cross sections in NRQCD. The electromagnetic op-erators are obtained by projecting on an intermediateQCD vacuum state,|0⟩, e.g.,ψ†χχ†ψ→ψ†χ|0⟩⟨0|χ†ψ.
Unlike in HQET, the power counting of NRQCDis not unique. The reason is that, while HQET is aone-scale EFT, its only dynamical scale beingΛQCD,NRQCD is still a multiscale EFT. The dynamical scalesofNRQCDare,atleast, mhv,mhv2,and ΛQCD.Inmorecomplicated settings even more scales may be relevant.
Hence, one can imagine different power countings: somemore conservative, like assuming that the matrix ele-ments all scale according to the largest dynamical scale,i.e., mhv, [1448], and some less conservative or closer to6.1 Nonrelativistic effective theory 199a perturbative counting [1436]. All the power countingshave in common that the kinetic energy scales like thebinding energy and that thereforeψ†i∂0ψis of the sameorder as ψ†∇2/(2mh)ψ, and analogously for the anti-quark. As we have mentioned above, this reflects thevirial theorem, an unavoidable consequence of the dy-namics of a nonrelativistic bound state.

(6.1.9)Note that this Lagrangian contains the heavy quarkmass,andthereforeviolatestheheavy-quarkflavorsym-metry; hence the bottomonium binding energy is differ-ent, even at leading order, from the charmonium one. Inthe power counting of Ref. [1436] one further assumes:D0 ∼mhv2 (when acting onψ or χ), D ∼mhv (whenacting on ψ or χ), gE ∼m2hv3, and gB ∼m2hv4. Aconsequence is that the heavy-quark spin symmetry isa symmetry of the leading-order NRQCD Lagrangian.
Another consequence is that the order 1/m3h kineticenergy operator ψ†D4/(8m3h)ψ and its charge conju-gated are of the same order as the 1/mh and 1/m2hoperators in Lψ and Lχ. Matrix elements of octet op-erators on quarkonium states are further suppressedby the fact that they project on subleading compo-nents of the quarkonium Fock state, the ones made ofa heavy quark-antiquark pair in a color octet configu-ration and gluons. The amount of suppression dependson the adopted power counting.
6.1.3 potential Nonrelativistic QCDNonrelativisticboundstatesinvolveenergyscales, mhv,mhv2, and ΛQCD, that are still dynamical and entan-gled in NRQCD. A consequence of this is that, althoughthe equations of motion that follow from the NRQCDLagrangian (6.1.9) resemble a Schrödinger equation fornonrelativistic bound states, they are not quite that.
They involve gauge fields and do not supply a fieldtheoretical definition and derivation of the potentialthat would appear in a Schrödinger equation. Never-theless, we expect that, in some nonrelativistic limit, aSchrödinger equation describing the quantum mechan-ics of the nonrelativistic bound state should emergefrom field theory, since field theory may be understoodas an extension of quantum mechanics that includesrelativistic and radiative corrections. Another conse-quence already remarked in the previous section is thatthe power counting of NRQCD is not unique.
Since the scalesmhvandmhv2 are hierarchically or-dered, they may be disentangled by systematically in-tegrating out modes associated with scales larger thanthe smallest scale,mhv2, and matching to a lower en-ergy EFT, where only degrees of freedom resolved atdistances of order1/(mhv2) are left dynamical [1422].
This EFT is pNRQCD [1449, 1450]. Because the scalemhv has been integrated out, the power counting ofpNRQCD is less ambiguous than the one of NRQCD.
In situations where we can neglect the hadronic scaleΛQCD,thepowercountingofpNRQCDisindeedunique,as its only dynamical scale ismhv2.
Having integrated out the scalemhvassociated withthe inverse of the distancer between the heavy quarkand antiquark, implies that pNRQCD is constructedas an expansion inr, with Wilson coefficients encod-ing non-analytic contributions inr. This is analogousto how HQET and NRQCD are constructed; there theheavy quark mass,mh, is integrated out and the EFTsare organized as expansions in1/mh, with Wilson coef-ficients encoding the non-analytic contributions in theform of logarithms ofmh. Some of the Wilson coeffi-cients of pNRQCD may be identified with the poten-tials in the Schrödinger equation of quarkonium.
The specific form of pNRQCD depends on the scaleΛQCD. If ΛQCD ≲ mhv2, then one deals with weakly-coupled bound states and the EFT is called weakly-coupledpNRQCD.Atdistancesoftheorderoforsmallerthan 1/(mhv2), one may still resolve colored degreesof freedom (gluons, quarks, and antiquarks), as colorconfinement has not yet set in. Hence gluons, quarks,and antiquarks are the degrees of freedom of weakly-coupled pNRQCD. Weakly-coupled pNRQCD is wellsuited to describe tightly bound quarkonia, like bot-tomonium and (to a less extent) charmonium groundstates, the Bc ground state, and threshold effects int¯t production. If ΛQCD ≳ mhv2, then one deals withstrongly-coupled bound states and the EFT is calledstrongly-coupled pNRQCD. At distances of the orderof 1/(mhv2), confinement has set in and the only avail-able degrees of freedom are color singlets. These are, inprinciple, all, ordinary and exotic, heavy, heavy-lightand light hadrons that we might have in the spectrum.
Strongly-coupled pNRQCD is suited to describe higherstates in the bottomonium and charmonium spectra, aswell as quarkonium exotica. Ifmhv ≫ΛQCD ≫mhv2,the matching to pNRQCD may be done in two steps,firstintegratingout(perturbatively) mhvthen(nonper-turbatively) ΛQCD. Contributions coming from thesetwo scales will be automatically factorized in pNRQCDobservables.200 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESWeakly-coupled pNRQCDThedegreesoffreedomof weakly-coupledpNRQCDareheavy quarks and antiquarks of momentummhv andenergy mhv2, gluons of momentum and energymhv2(sometimes called ultrasoft gluons), and light quarks ofmomentum and energymhv2; these remain after gluons(sometimes called soft gluons) and light quarks of en-ergy or momentummhv have been integrated out fromNRQCD. Because a single heavy quark and antiquarkcannot be resolved at the scalemhv2, it is useful to castheavy quark and antiquark fields into bilocal fields thatdepend on time, t, the center of mass coordinate,R,and the relative coordinate,r. We call the color singletcomponent of the quark and antiquark field S, and itscolor octet component O, normalized toS = 1 3×3S/√3and O =√2OATA. The distancerscales like1/(mhv),while the center of mass coordinate,R, and the time,t,scale like 1/(mhv2), because the quark-antiquark pairmay only recoil against ultrasoft gluons. To ensure thatgluons are ultrasoft in the pNRQCD Lagrangian, gaugefields are multipole expanded inr. Hence gauge fields inthe pNRQCD Lagrangian only depend on time and thecenter of mass coordinate. The pNRQCD Lagrangianis organized as a double expansion in1/mh and r. Atorder r in the multipole expansion, the weakly-coupledpNRQCD Lagrangian density has the form [1449, 1450]LweakpNRQCD =LS,O + Lℓ, (6.1.10)withLS,O =∫d3rTr{S†(i∂0 −hs)S + O †(iD0O−ho)O}−VATr{O†r ·gE S + S †r ·gE O}−VB2 Tr{O†r ·gE O + O †Or ·gE},(6.1.11)where, up to order1/m2h, and including the1/m3h termsin the kinetic energies,hs = p2mh+ P24mh− p44m3h+ ··· + Vs, (6.1.12)ho = p2mh+ P24mh− p44m3h+ ··· + Vo. (6.1.13)The covariant derivative acting on the octet field is de-fined as iD0O = i∂0O + g[A0(R,t),O], P = −iDR isthe (gauge covariant) center of mass momentum,p =−i∇r is the relative momentum, andhs and ho may beinterpreted as the Hamiltonians of the color singlet andcolor octet heavy quark-antiquark fields. The dots inEqs. (6.1.12) and (6.1.13) stand for higher-order termsin the nonrelativistic expansion of the kinetic energy.
The trace in Eq. (6.1.11) is in spin and in color space.
The Lagrangian Lℓ is the Lagrangian of the light de-grees of freedom (6.1.3) inherited from NRQCD.
The quantitiesVs, Vo, VA, andVB are Wilson coeffi-cientsofpNRQCD.Theyencodecontributionsfromthesoft degrees of freedom that have been integrated outfrom NRQCD. Because (under the hierarchy of weakly-coupled pNRQCD) the soft scale,mhv, is larger thanΛQCD, the Wilson coefficients may be computed in per-turbation theory, order by order inαs. They are, ingeneral, functions ofr, as well as of the spin and mo-mentum. At leading order,VA and VB are 1; they getpossible corrections at orderα2s [1451]. The coefficientsVs and Vo may be identified with the color singlet andoctet potentials, respectively. To leading orderV(0)s =−4αs/(3r) and V(0)o = αs/(6r), which are the Coulombpotentials in the color SU(3) fundamental and adjointrepresentation, respectively. The potentialsVs and Vocontain, however, also momentum- and spin-dependentcorrections. For the singlet case (the octet case is anal-ogous) we can write, up to order1/m2h:Vs = V(0)s (r) + V(1)s (r)mh+ V(2)SIm2h+ V(2)SDm2h, (6.1.14)where, at order 1/m2h we have distinguished betweenspin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) terms.
In turn, they can be organized asV(2)SI =V(2)r (r) + 14V(2)p2,CM(r)P2 + 14V(2)L2,CM(r)r2 (r ×P)2+ 12{V(2)p2 (r),p2}+ V(2)L2 (r)r2 L2 , (6.1.15)V(2)SD =12V(2)LS,CM(r) (r ×P) ·(S1 −S2) + V(2)LS(r) L ·S+ V(2)S2 (r) S2 + V(2)S12 (r) S12 , (6.1.16)where {, }stands for the anticommutator,S = S1 + S2 = (σ1 + σ2)/2is the total spin (Si = σi/2 is the spin of the particlei), L = r×p is the relative orbital angular momentum,andS12 = 3( ˆr ·σ1)(ˆr ·σ2) −σ1 ·σ2 .
The potentialV(0)s is the static potential, the potentialproportional to V(2)LS may be identified with the spin-orbit potential, the potential proportional toV(2)S2 withthe spin-spin potential and the potential proportionalto V(2)S12 with the spin tensor potential. The potentialsthat contribute in the center of mass reference frameare, at leading (non-vanishing) order in perturbation6.1 Nonrelativistic effective theory 201theory (see, e.g., Ref. [1422]):V(1)(r) = −2α2sr2 , (6.1.17)V(2)r (r) = 43παsδ(3)(r ) , V (2)p2 (r) = −4αs3r , (6.1.18)V(2)L2 (r) = 2αs3r , V (2)LS(r) = 2αsr3 , (6.1.19)V(2)S2 (r) = 16παs9 δ(3)(r ) , V(2)S12 (r) = αs3r3 . (6.1.20)Potentials that depend on the center of mass momen-tum are relevant only if the quarkonium is recoiling,like in hadronic and electromagnetic transitions.
Beyond leading order, the static potential is knownup to three-loop accuracy [1452–1454], and also sub-leading logarithms showing up at four loops have beencomputed [1455]; the1/mh potential is known up to or-derα3s [1456],and 1/m2h potentialsuptoorder α2s (thesepotentials have a long history, see Ref. [1457] and refer-ences therein). We have assumed that the heavy quarkand antiquark have equal masses; for the case of a quarkand an antiquark of different masses, we refer, for in-stance, to Refs. [1399, 1422, 1458–1460].
TheWilsoncoefficientsofpNRQCDinherittheWil-son coefficients of NRQCD. Hence, some of the cou-plings appearing in the expansion of the Wilson coeffi-cients are naturally computed at the scale of NRQCD,mh, while others, encoding the soft contributions, arenaturally computed at the soft scale,mhv. In weakly-coupled pNRQCD, because the leading potential is theCoulomb potential, the Bohr radius is proportional to1/(mhαs) and v∼αs. Finally, like in any non relativis-tic EFT, also the Wilson coefficients of pNRQCD arerelated through constraints imposed by the Poincaréinvariance of QCD, as we have seen at work in HQETand NRQCD. These constraints set the coefficients ofthekinetictermsappearinginEqs.( 6.1.12)and( 6.1.13)to be the ones coming from expanding the relativistickinetic energies of a free quark and antiquark. Further-more they fix the potentials depending on the centerof mass momentum by expressing them in terms of thestatic potential,VLS,CM = −12rdV(0)sdr , V L2,CM = −r2dV(0)sdr ,Vp2,CM = r2dV(0)sdr −12V(0)s .
These and other constraints have been derived in Refs.
[1399, 1447, 1459, 1461, 1462]. These relations are ex-act, i.e., valid at any order in perturbation theory and,when applicable, also nonperturbatively.
In the pNRQCD Lagrangian the relative coordinater plays the role of a continuous parameter labeling dif-ferent fields. The dynamical spacetime coordinates ofthe Lagrangian density are the time t and the coor-dinate R, which, in the case of the fields S and O, isthe center of mass coordinate. Having written the La-grangian in terms of singlet and octet fields has madeeach term in Eq. (6.1.11) explicitly gauge invariant.
The power counting of weakly-coupled pNRQCDis straightforward. We have already found that r ∼1/(mhv) and t, R ∼ 1/(mhv2). Momenta scale likep ∼mhv and P ∼mhv2. Gluon fields and light quarkfields are ultrasoft and scale like mhv2 or ΛQCD totheirdimension.Theleading-ordersingletHamiltonian,p2/mh+ V(0)s , scales likemhv2 (and analogously in theoctet case), which is the order of the Bohr levels. Thepotentials listed in Eqs. (6.1.17)-(6.1.20) contribute toVs at ordermhv4, asαs ∼v.
The first correction to a pure potential picture ofthe quarkonium interaction comes from the chromo-electric dipole interaction terms in the second line ofEq. (6.1.11). These operators are of order g(mhv2)2/(mhv) ∼gmhv3. In order to project on color singletstates, the chromoelectric dipole interaction may enteronly in loop diagrams, which at leading order is a self-energy diagram with two chromoelectric dipole vertices.
Suchaself-energydiagramisoforder g2(mhv2)3/(mhv)2 ∼g2mhv4. The couplingg2 is computed at the ultrasoftscale. Hence, ifΛQCD ≪mhv2, the coupling is pertur-bative and the self-energy diagram with two chromo-electric dipole vertices is suppressed with respect to thecontributionscomingfromthepotentialsinEqs.( 6.1.17)-(6.1.20).
Elsewhere, ifΛQCD ∼mhv2, it is of the same order.
At leading order in the multipole expansion, theequation of motion for the singlet field isi∂0S = hsS, (6.1.21)which is the Schrödinger equation that in quantum me-chanics describes the evolution of a nonrelativistic bo-und state. Potential NRQCD provides therefore a fieldtheoretical foundation of the Schrödinger equation, arigorous QCD definition and derivation of its potential,and the range of validity of the quantum mechanicalpicture. Ultrasoft gluons start contributing, and there-fore correcting the potential picture, at ordermhv4 (forΛQCD ∼mhv2) or mhv5 (for ΛQCD ≪mhv2) in thespectrum.
Not only the static potential is derived from firstprinciples in pNRQCD, but all higher-order correctionsinthenonrelativisticexpansion,includingthespin-orbit,spin-spin and Darwin term as well. In general, the po-tentials factorize soft contributions from radiative cor-rections at the scalemh. These last ones are encoded inthe matching coefficients inherited from NRQCD, e.g.,all 1/m2h spin-dependent potentials contain the Fermi202 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIEScoefficient cF. Since the potentials are Wilson coeffi-cients of an EFT, they are regularized, undergo renor-malization and satisfy renormalization group equationsthat allow to resum potentially large logarithms in theirexpressions [1451, 1452, 1463–1469]. The scale depen-dence of the Wilson coefficients cancels in physical ob-servables. For instance, the QCD static potential is in-frared sensitive at three loops [1470], a sensitivity thatstems from the fact that a static quark-antiquark pairmay change its color status by emitting an ultrasoftgluon. The infrared sensitivity of the static potentialcancels in the computation of the static energy againstthe self-energy diagram with two chromoelectric dipoleverticesconsideredabove,inasortofnon-AbelianLambshift mechanism [1452].
Weakly-coupledpNRQCDrequiresthefulfillmentofthe condition ΛQCD ≲ mhv2. The conditionΛQCD ≪mtv2 is certainly fulfilled by top-antitop quark pairsnear threshold. The production oft¯tpairs near thresh-old is expected to be measured with precision at futurelinear colliders, providing, among others, a determina-tion of the top mass with an uncertainty well below100 MeV, which is a crucial input to test the StandardModel.Thisrequiresacomparabletheoreticalaccuracy,which has led in the last decades to several high-ordercalculations of the near threshold cross section in theframework of nonrelativistic EFTs of QCD [1471–1477].
The condition ΛQCD ≲ mhv2 is also fulfilled by com-pact and Coulombic quarkonia. Examples are the bot-tomonium ground state, the ground state of theBc sys-tem, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the charmoniumground state, and the first bottomonium excited states.
We recall that in a Coulombic system the size is pro-portional to the inverse of the mass and to the principalquantum number. A review on applications of weakly-coupled pNRQCD to several tightly bound quarkoniacan be found in Ref. [1478].
Weak-coupling determinations of the bottomoniumground state masses are typically used to extract thecharm and bottom masses [1407, 1479–1487]. Hence,they provide alternative observables for the extractionof the heavy quark masses to the heavy-light mesonmassesdiscussedinSec. 6.1.1.Theresultsareconsistentwith the ones presented in Sec.6.1.1. The present pre-cision is N3LO; the determination of the bottom massincludes the effects due to the charm mass at two loops.
Once the heavy quark masses have been established forone set of spectroscopy observables, they can be usedfor others like theBc mass or theBc spectrum (see Ref.
[1458] for an early work and Ref. [1460] for a state of theart calculation at N3LO). Fine and hyperfine splittingsof charmonium and bottomonium have been computedperturbatively in Refs. [1488, 1489] and to NLL accu-racy in Ref. [1490], similarly for theB∗c-Bc hyperfinesplitting in Ref. [1491]. After more than one decade ofwork the whole perturbative heavy quarkonium spec-trum has been computed at N3LO [1464, 1492–1497].
Recently, this result has been further improved reach-ing N3LL accuracy up to a missing contribution of thetwo-loopsoftrunning[ 1468,1469].TheN 3LLorderrep-resents the presently achievable precision of these cal-culations. Going beyond this precision will require amajor computational effort, like the four-loop determi-nation of the static potential. Electromagnetic decaysof the bottomonium lowest levels have been computedincluding N2LL corrections in Refs. [1473, 1498]. A dif-ferent power counting that includes at leading orderthe exact static potential has been used for these quan-tities in Ref. [1499]. Corrections to the wave functionand leptonic decay width of theΥ(1S) at N3LO havebeen computed in Refs. [1500, 1501]. Nonperturbativecorrections in the form of condensates have been in-cluded in Refs. [1502, 1503]. Radiative quarkonium de-cays have been analyzed in Refs. [1504–1509]. Radiativeand inclusive decays of theΥ(1S) may also serve as adetermination of αs at the bottom mass scale [1510].
Radiative transitions, M1 and E1, at relative orderv2in the velocity expansion have been computed in Refs.
[1511–1514]; noteworthily, pNRQCD may explain theobserved tinyΥ(2S) →γηb(1S) branching fraction. Fi-nally, the photon line shape in the radiative transitionJ/ψ →γηc(1S) has been studied in Ref. [1515].
Strongly-coupled pNRQCDWhen the hierarchy of scales isΛQCD ≫mhv2, pN-RQCD is a strongly-coupled theory. This condition maybe appropriate to describe higher quarkonium states,and quarkonium exotica. Strongly-coupled pNRQCD isobtained by integrating out the hadronic scaleΛQCD,which means that all colored degrees of freedom areabsent [1422, 1448, 1516–1519].
Let us consider the case of strongly-coupled pN-RQCD for ordinary quarkonia. Lattice QCD shows ev-idence that the quarkonium static energy is separatedby a gap of orderΛQCD from the energies of the glu-onicexcitationsbetweenthestaticquark-antiquarkpair[1520]. If, in addition, the binding energies of the statesthat can be constructed out of the quarkonium staticenergy are also separated by a gap of orderΛQCD fromthe binding energies of the states that can be con-structed out of the static energies of the gluonic ex-citations, and from open-flavor states, then one can in-tegrate out all these latter states. The resulting EFTis made of a quark-antiquark color singlet field, whosemodes are the quarkonium states, and light hadrons.
The coupling of quarkonia with light hadrons has been6.1 Nonrelativistic effective theory 203considered in the framework of pNRQCD in Ref. [1521].
Itimpactsverymildlyspectralproperties(masses,widths)of quarkonia that lie well below the open-flavor thresh-old. For such quarkonia we may neglect their couplingswith light hadrons and the pNRQCD Lagrangian den-sity assumes the particularly simple form:LstrongpNRQCD =∫d3rTr{S† (i∂0 −hs) S}. (6.1.22)TheHamiltonian, hs,hasthesameformasinEqs.( 6.1.12)and (6.1.14)-(6.1.16). The equation of motion is theSchrödinger equation (6.1.21).
The nonperturbative dynamics is encoded in the po-tentials, which at order1/mh is V(1)s and at order1/m2harethespin-independentandspin-dependenttermsiden-tified in Eqs. (6.1.15) and (6.1.16). What distinguishesthe EFT from phenomenological potential models canbe summarized as follows:(i) The potentials are products of Wilson coeffi-cients, factorizing contributions from the high-energyscale, mh, and low-energy matrix elements, encodingcontributions coming from the scalesmhv and ΛQCD.
The exact expressions follow from matching pNRQCDwith its high-energy completion, which is NRQCD.
(ii)Thehigh-energyWilsoncoefficientsofpNRQCDare inherited from NRQCD. These are the Wilson coef-ficients in the NRQCD Lagrangian (6.1.7). Because theNRQCD Wilson coefficients have a real and an imagi-nary part, also the pNRQCD potentials develop a realpart, responsible for the quarkonium binding, and animaginary part, responsible for the quarkonium annihi-lation. At higher orders, also contributions coming fromthe scale√mhΛQCD may become relevant [1519].
(iii) The low-energy matrix elements are nonpertur-bative. Their field-theoretical expressions, relevant forpotentials up to order1/m2h, are known.
Thestaticpotentialisequalto limT→∞i ln W/T,whereW is the expectation value of a rectangular Wilson loopof spatial extension r and temporal extension T [80,1522–1524]. Similarly, the low-energy real parts of theother potentials can be expressed in terms of Wilsonloops and field insertions on them [768, 1516, 1517].
TheseWilsonloopsmaybecomputedinweakly-coupledQCD giving back the weak-coupling potentials listed atleading order in Eqs. (6.1.17)-(6.1.20) [1525] or nonper-turbativelyvialatticeQCD.Indeed,thecomputationofthese potentials has a long history that begins with theinception of lattice QCD. Their most recent determina-tions can be found in Refs. [769, 1526, 1527], see alsoRef. [1528]. Noteworthily the long-distance behaviourof the potentials agrees with the expectations of theeffective string theory [1525, 1529–1531].
Thelow-energycontributionstotheimaginarypartsof the potential are matrix elements of the NRQCDfour-fermion operators. Hence they are local terms pro-portional toδ3(r) or derivatives of it. Nonperturbativecontributions are encoded into constants that may beexpressed in terms of momenta of correlators of chro-moelectric and/or chromomagnetic fields [1448, 1518],and eventually fixed on data or computed with latticeQCD.
(iv) Finally, pNRQCD is renormalizable order byorder in the expansion parameters in both its weak-coupling and strong-coupling versions. In particular,quantum-mechanical perturbation theory can be im-plemented at any order without incurring uncanceleddivergences like in purely phenomenological potentialmodels.
Strongly-coupled pNRQCD has been used to com-pute quarkonium inclusive and electromagnetic decaywidths [1423, 1448, 1518, 1519], and hadronic and elec-tromagnetic production cross sections [1532–1536]. TheadvantagewithrespecttotheNRQCDapproachisthat,while the NRQCD four-fermion matrix elements de-pend on the quarkonium state, their pNRQCD expres-sion factorizes all the quarkonium dependence into thewave function at the origin (or its derivatives) squared.
The wave function at the origin squared gets multi-plied by momenta of correlators of field-strength ten-sors, F, that are universal, quarkonium independent,constants. Schematically, one obtains for the expres-sion of a generic NRQCD four-fermion matrix elementin pNRQCD, entering either quarkonium production ordecay, that⟨4-fermion⟩∼|wave-function(0)|2×∫dt···⟨F(t) ···F(0)⟩. (6.1.23)This leads to a significant reduction in the number ofnonperturbative parameters and allows to use infor-mation gained in the charmonium sector to make pre-dictions in the bottomonium sector. Finally, pNRQCDconbined with the multipole expansion has been usedto compute quarkonium hadronic transitions in Ref.
[1537].
pNRQCD for systems other than quarkoniaPotential NRQCD can be used to describe systems withthree valence quarks, two of them heavy [1411, 1412,1418, 1419, 1538, 1539]. This is because the nonrela-tivistic hierarchy of scales given in Eq. (6.1.6) is pre-served,whichallowstosystematicallyintegrateoutthesescales to describe eventually the baryon with a suitableEFT. If the heavy quark-quark distance is of the or-der of1/ΛQCD, then the valence light-quark affects the204 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESquark-quark potential. Elsewhere, if the heavy quark-quark distance is smaller than1/ΛQCD, then we maydisentangle the quark-quark dynamics, described by aperturbative quark-quark potential, from the couplingof the heavy-quark pair with the light quark. Since inthis last case, the light quark sees the heavy-quark pairas a pointlike particle, its interaction with the heavy-quark pair is described by HQET.
One can devise EFTs for describing low-energy mo-des of baryons made of three heavy quarks. These stateshave not been discovered yet in experiments, but theyoffer a unique tool to study confinement and the transi-tion region from the Coulombic regime to the confinedone in non-trivial geometrical settings [1538], using, forinstance the three-quark static potential computed inlattice QCD [1540–1542].
Possible bound states made of two quarkonia or ofa quarkonium and a nucleon (hadroquarkonium) maybe characterized by even lower energy scales than thosecharacterizingthebindinginquarkoniaorbaryonsmadeof at least two heavy quarks. These lower energy scalesarethoseassociatedwithpionexchangesresponsibleforthe long-range interaction. One can treat these systemsin an EFT framework by starting from the pNRQCDdescription of the quarkonium and the heavy-baryonchiral effective theory description of the nucleon. Thelong-range pion exchange interaction sets the scale ofthe typical size of the system to be of the order of1/Mπ,i.e., much larger than the size of the quarkonium andeven larger than its typical time scale, which is of theorder of the inverse of the binding energy.
Once modes associated with the quarkonium bind-ing energy andMπ have been integrated out, the quar-konium-quarkonium or the quarkonium-nucleon inter-action is described by a potential that, in this way, hasbeen systematically computed from QCD. The couplingof quarkonium with the pions is encoded in a Wilsoncoefficient that may be identified with the quarkoniumchromoelectricpolarizability[ 1543].Inthequarkonium-quarkonium system, the lowest energy EFT describingmodes of energy and momentum of orderM2π/(2mh)is called van der Waals EFT (WEFT) [1521, 1544].
The resulting potential is, in fact, the van der Waalspotential. In the quarkonium-nucleon system, the low-est energy EFT describing modes of energy and mo-mentum of order M2π/(2Λχ) has been dubbed poten-tial quarkonium-nucleon EFT (pQNEFT) [1545]. Suchframeworks may be relevant to describe heavy pen-taquarks.
Quarkonium-like multiparticle systems, where thelight degrees of freedom remain adiabatically in a sta-tionary state with respect to the heavy quark motion,can be studied within the Born–Oppenheimer approx-imation that may be implemented in a suitable ver-sion of pNRQCD called Born–Oppenheimer effectivefield theory (BOEFT) [772, 1546, 1547]. This frame-work has been applied to quarkonium hybrids, quarko-nium tetraquarks and to heavy-meson threshold effects[1421,1548–1551].Finally,nonrelativisticEFTslikepN-RQCD are also advantageous in describing the propa-gation of quarkonium in a thermal medium either inequilibrium [1552–1557] or out of equilibrium [1558–1562]; see also Sec.6.6.
6.2 Chiral perturbation theoryStefan Scherer and Matthias SchindlerChiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is an effective fieldtheorythatdescribesthepropertiesofstrongly-interactingsystems at energies far below typical hadron masses.
The degrees of freedom are hadrons instead of the un-derlying quarks and gluons. ChPT is a systematic andmodel-independent approximation method based on anexpansion of amplitudes in terms of light-quark massesandmomenta.ThefollowingisabriefoverviewofChPTthat is largely based on Ref.

(6.2.1)For each quark flavorf, the quark fieldqf is a colortriplet, transforming in the triplet representation,qf(x) ↦→U(x)qf(x), (6.2.2)where U(x) denotes a smooth space-time-dependentSU(3) matrix. Using the Gell-Mann matrices [1564],the eight gluon fieldsAAµ are collected in a traceless,Hermitian, 3 ×3 matrix Aµ = λAAAµ/2 (summationover repeated indices implied), transforming inhomo-geneously under a gauge transformation,Aµ(x) ↦→U(x)Aµ(x)U†(x) + igs∂µU(x)U†(x), (6.2.3)where gs denotes the SU(3) gauge coupling constant.
In terms ofAµ, the covariant derivative of the quarkfields is defined asDµqf = (∂µ + igsAµ) qf. (6.2.4)6.2 Chiral perturbation theory 205Finally, the field strength tensor is given byFµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ + igs[Aµ,Aν]. (6.2.5)By construction, the Lagrangian of Eq. (6.2.1) is invari-ant under the combined transformations of Eqs. (6.2.2)and (6.2.3). From the point of view of gauge invariance,the strong-interaction Lagrangian could also involve aterm of the type (c.f. Eq. (1.1.6) from Sec.1.1)Lθ = g2s¯θ32π2 ϵµνρσTrc(FµνFρσ) , ϵ 0123 = 1, (6.2.6)where ϵµνρσ denotes the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civitatensor.Theso-called θtermofEq.( 6.2.6)impliesan explicit P and CP violation of the strong interac-tions. The present empirical information on the neutronelectric dipole moment [1565] indicates that theθ termis small and, in the following, we will omit Eq. (6.2.6)from our discussion.
Since the covariant derivative of the quark fields isflavor independent, the Lagrangian of Eq. (6.2.1) hasadditional, accidental, and in this case global, symme-tries aside from the gauge symmetry. Both the dynam-ics of the theory (via spontaneous symmetry breaking)and the values of the quark masses impact how thesesymmetries are (approximately) realized in nature. Dy-namical chiral symmetry breaking introduces the scaleΛχ = 4πF0 (see below) of the order of 1 GeV [1566]. Inthis context it is common to divide the six quark flavorsinto the three light quarksu, d, and s with ml < Λχand the three heavy flavorsc, b, and t with mh > Λχ(as discussed in the previous subsection). As a theoreti-cal starting point, one may consider two limits, namely,sending the light-quark masses to zero (chiral limit) andthe heavy-quark masses to infinity. In Ref. [1567], thissituation is referred to as a “theoretician’s paradise.” Inthe following, we exclusively concentrate on the chirallimit for either two (u,d) or three (u,d,s ) light quarksand omit the heavy quarks from our discussion. Intro-ducing left-handed and right-handed quark fields (colorand flavor indices omitted) asqL = 12 (1 −γ5) q, qR = 12 (1 + γ5) q, γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3,(6.2.7)theQCDLagrangianinthechirallimitdecomposesintoL0QCD =∑l=u,d,s(¯qL,li/DqL,l + ¯qR,li/DqL,R)−12Trc(FµνFµν) . (6.2.8)In the massless limit, the helicity of a quark is a goodquantum number which is conserved in the interac-tion with gluons. Moreover, the classical Lagrangianin the chiral limit has a global U(3)L ×U(3)R sym-metry, i.e. , it is invariant under independent unitaryflavor transformations of the left-handed and the right-handed quark fields,qL ↦→ULqL, q R ↦→URqR.
At the classical level, this chiral symmetry results in2 ×(8 + 1) = 18 conserved currents:Lµa = ¯qLγµλa2 qL, R µa = ¯qRγµλa2 qR, a = 1,..., 8,Vµ = ¯qRγµqR + ¯qLγµqL, A µ = ¯qRγµqR −¯qLγµqL.
Here, the Gell-Mann matrices act in flavor space, sinceqR and qL are flavor triplets.62 Because of quantumeffects the singlet axial-vector currentAµ = ¯qγµγ5q de-velops a so-called anomaly, resulting in the divergenceequation∂µAµ = 3g2s16π2 ϵµνρσTrc(FµνFρσ) . (6.2.9)The factor of three originates from the number of fla-vors.Inthelarge Nc (numberofcolors)limitofRef.[ 1163]the singlet axial-vector current is conserved, becausethe strong coupling constant behaves asg2s ∼N−1c .
In the quantized theory, the spatial integrals overthe charge densities of the symmetry currents give riseto the charge operatorsQLa, QRa (a = 1 ,..., 8), andQV.TheyaregeneratorsofthegroupSU (3)L×SU(3)R×U(1)V, acting on the Hilbert space of QCD, and satisfythe commutation relations[QLa,QLb] = ifabcQLc, (6.2.10a)[QRa,QRb] = ifabcQRc, (6.2.10b)[QLa,QRb] = 0 , (6.2.10c)[QLa,QV] = [ QRa,QV] = 0 , (6.2.10d)where thefabc are the totally antisymmetric structureconstants of the Lie algebra of SU(3) [1564]. In the chi-ral limit, these operators are time independent,i.e. ,they commute with the Hamiltonian in the chiral limit,[QLa,H0QCD] = [ QRa,H0QCD] = [ QV,H0QCD] = 0 .
(6.2.11)Itisconvenienttoconsiderthelinearcombinations QAa ≡QRa −QLa and QVa ≡QRa + QLa, which transformas QAa ↦→−QAa and QVa ↦→QVa under parity. Thehadron spectrum can be organized in multiplets be-longing to irreducible representations of SU(3)V with agiven baryon number. If not only the vector subgroup,62 Lower case Roman letters denote SU(3) flavor indices.206 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESbut the full group were realized linearly by the spec-trum of the hadrons, one would expect a so-called par-ity doubling of mass-degenerate states. The absence ofsuch a doubling in the low-energy spectrum is an in-dication that the SU(3)L ×SU(3)R chiral symmetry isdynamically broken in the ground state. One then as-sumes that the axial generatorsQAa do not annihilatethe ground state of QCD,QAa|0⟩̸= 0. (6.2.12)As a consequence of the Goldstone theorem [12], eachaxial generatorQAa not annihilating the ground statecorrespondstoa massless Goldstone-bosonfield φa withspin0,whosesymmetrypropertiesaretightlyconnectedto the generator in question. The Goldstone bosonshave the same transformation behavior under parity asthe axial generators,φa(t,⃗ x)P↦→−φa(t,−⃗ x), (6.2.13)i.e. , they are pseudoscalars. From Eqs. (6.2.10a) and(6.2.10b) one obtains[QVa,QAb] = ifabcQAc and thusthe Goldstone bosons transform under the subgroupSU(3)V, which leaves the vacuum invariant, as an octet:[QVa,φb(x)] = ifabcφc(x). (6.2.14)The members of the pseudoscalar octet(π,K,η ) of thereal world are identified as the Goldstone bosons ofQCD and would be massless for massless quarks.
After turning on the quark masses in terms of themass termLM = −¯qMq= −(¯qRMqL + ¯qLM†qR),M= diag(mu,md,ms),the Goldstone bosons will no longer be massless (seebelow). Moreover, the symmetry currents are no longerconserved. In terms of the vector currentsVµa = Rµa −Lµa and the axial-vector currentsAµa = Rµa −Lµa, thecorresponding divergences read∂µVµa = i¯q[M,λa2]q, ∂ µAµa = i¯qγ5{λa2 ,M}q.
(6.2.15)The properties of the currents corresponding to theapproximate chiral symmetry of QCD can be summar-ized as follows:1. In the limit of massless quarks, the sixteen currentsLµa and Rµa or, alternatively, Vµa = Rµa + Lµa andAµa = Rµa −Lµa are conserved. The same is truefor the singlet vector currentVµ, whereas the sin-glet axial-vector current Aµ has an anomaly (seeEq. (6.2.9)).
2. For any values of quark masses, the individual flavorcurrents ¯uγµu, ¯dγµd, and¯sγµsare always conservedin the strong interactions reflecting the flavor inde-pendence of the strong coupling and the diagonalform of the quark-mass matrix. Of course, the sin-glet vector currentVµ, being the sum of the threeflavor currents, is always conserved.
3. In addition to the anomaly, the singlet axial-vectorcurrent has an explicit divergence due to the quarkmasses:∂µAµ = 2i¯qγ5Mq+ 3g2s16π2 ϵµνρσTrc(FµνFρσ) .
4. For equal quark masses,mu = md = ms, the eightvector currentsVµa are conserved, because[λa,1 ] =0. Such a scenario is the origin of the SU(3) symme-try originally proposed by Gell-Mann and Ne’eman[1568]. The eight axial-vector currentsAµa are notconserved. The divergences of the octet axial-vectorcurrents of Eq. (6.2.15) are proportional to pseu-doscalar quadratic forms. This can be interpretedas the microscopic origin of the PCAC relation (par-tiallyconservedaxial-vectorcurrent)[ 19,1569]whichstates that the divergences of the axial-vector cur-rents are proportional to renormalized field opera-torsrepresentingthelowest-lyingpseudoscalaroctet.
5. Takingmu = md ̸= ms reducesSU(3)flavorsymme-try to SU(2) isospin symmetry.
6. Taking mu ̸= md leads to isospin-symmetry break-ing.
Besides the conservation properties of the currents, onemay also calculate their commutators (current alge-bra), which may then be used to derive certain relationsamong QCD Green functions analogous to the Wardidentities of Quantum Electrodynamics. The set of allQCD Green functions involving color-neutral quark bi-linears is very efficiently collected in a generating func-tional,exp (iZQCD[v,a,s,p ]) = ⟨0|Texp[i∫d4xLext(x)]|0⟩0,(6.2.16)where [64, 1570]:Lext =8∑a=1vµa ¯qγµλa2 q+ vµ(s)13 ¯qγµq+8∑a=1aµa ¯qγµγ5λa2 q−8∑a=0sa ¯qλaq+8∑a=0pai¯qγ5λaq= ¯qγµ(vµ + 13vµ(s) + γ5aµ)q−¯q(s−iγ5p)q,(6.2.17)6.2 Chiral perturbation theory 207where λ0 =√23 1 . A particular Green function is thenobtained through a partial functional derivative withrespect to the corresponding external fields. Note thatboth the quark field operatorsqin Lext and the groundstate |0⟩refer to the chiral limit, indicated by the sub-script0inEq.( 6.2.16).Thequarkfieldsareoperatorsinthe Heisenberg picture and have to satisfy the equationof motion and the canonical anticommutation relations.
From the generating functional, we can even obtainGreen functions of the “real world,” where the quarkfields and the ground state are those with finite quarkmasses.Tothatendoneneedstoevaluatethefunctionalderivative of Eq. (6.2.16) ats= diag(mu,md,ms). Thechiral Ward identities result from an invariance of thegeneratingfunctionalofEq.( 6.2.16)undera local trans-formation of the quark fields and a simultaneous trans-formation of the external fields [64, 1570],qL ↦→exp(−iΘ(x)3)VL(x)qL, (6.2.18a)qR ↦→exp(−iΘ(x)3)VR(x)qR, (6.2.18b)where VL(x) and VR(x) are independent space-time-dependent SU(3) matrices, provided the external fieldsare subject to the transformationslµ ↦→VLlµV†L + iVL∂µV†L, (6.2.19a)rµ ↦→VRrµV†R + iVR∂µV†R, (6.2.19b)v(s)µ ↦→v(s)µ −∂µΘ, (6.2.19c)s+ ip↦→VR(s+ ip)V†L, (6.2.19d)s−ip↦→VL(s−ip)V†R. (6.2.19e)The derivative terms in Eqs. (6.2.19a)-(6.2.19c) servethe same purpose as in the construction of gauge theo-ries, i.e. , they cancel analogous terms originating fromthe kinetic part of the quark Lagrangian.
6.2.2 Chiral perturbation theory for mesonsEffective field theory (EFT) is a powerful tool for de-scribing the strong interactions at low energies. Theessential idea behind EFT was formulated by Weinbergin Ref. [1387] as follows:“... if one writes down the most general possibleLagrangian, including all terms consistent withassumed symmetry principles, and then calcu-lates matrix elements with this Lagrangian toany given order of perturbation theory, the re-sult will simply be the most general possibleS–matrix consistent with analyticity, perturba-tive unitarity, cluster decomposition and the as-sumed symmetry principles.”In the present context, we want to describe the low-energy dynamics of QCD in terms of its Goldstonebosons as effective degrees of freedom rather than interms of quarks and gluons. The resulting low-energyapproximation is called (mesonic) chiral perturbationtheory (ChPT). Its foundations are discussed in Ref.
[1571]. Since the interaction strength of the Goldstonebosons vanishes in the zero-energy limit and the quarkmasses are regarded as small perturbations around thechiral limit, the mesonic Lagrangian is organized in asimultaneous derivative and a quark-mass expansion.
ThisLagrangianisexpectedtohaveexactlyeightpseudo-scalar degrees of freedom transforming as an octet un-der flavor SU(3)V. Moreover, taking account of spon-taneous symmetry breaking, the ground state shouldonly be invariant under SU(3)V ×U(1)V. Finally, inthe chiral limit, we want the effective Lagrangian to beinvariant under SU(3)L ×SU(3)R ×U(1)V.
Our goal is to approximate the “true” generatingfunctional ZQCD[v,a,s,p ] of Eq. (6.2.16) by a sequenceZ(2)eﬀ [v,a,s,p ] + Z(4)eﬀ [v,a,s,p ] + ... ,where the effective generating functionals are obtainedusingtheeffectivefieldtheory.Therationaleunderlyingthis approach is the assumption that including all of theinfinite number of effective functionalsZ(2n)eﬀ [v,a,s,p ]will, at least in the low-energy region, generate a resultwhichisequivalenttothatobtainedfrom ZQCD[v,a,s,p ].
Because of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the chi-ral group SU(3)L ×SU(3)R is realized nonlinearly onthe Goldstone-boson fields [1387, 1572]. We define theSU(3) matrixU(x) = exp(iφ(x)F0), (6.2.20)where the field matrixφis a Hermitian, traceless3 ×3matrix,φ(x) =8∑a=1φaλa ≡π0 + 1√3 η√2π+ √2K+√2π− −π0 + 1√3 η√2K0√2K− √2 ¯K0 −2√3 η,(6.2.21)and the parameter F0 is the chiral limit of the pion-decayconstant.Under local chiraltransformations, U(x)transforms as [64]U(x) ↦→VR(x)U(x)V†L(x). (6.2.22)In particular, Eq. (6.2.22) implies for the field matrixφ the transformation behaviorφ(x) ↦→Vφ(x)V† underglobal flavor SU(3)V, i.e. , the Goldstone bosons indeed208 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESform an SU(3) octet [see Eq. (6.2.14)]. The most gen-eral Lagrangian with the smallest (nonzero) number ofexternal fields is given by [64]L2 = F204 Tr[DµU(DµU)†]+ F204 Tr(χU†+Uχ†), (6.2.23)whereDµU ≡∂µU −irµU + iUlµ ↦→VRDµUV †L, (6.2.24a)χ≡2B0(s+ ip) ↦→VRχV†L. (6.2.24b)If we denote a small four momentum as ofO(q), thecovariant derivative counts as O(q) and χ as O(q2)(see below), such that the lowest-order Lagrangian isof O(q2), indicated by the subscript 2. Using the cyclicproperty of the trace,L2 is easily seen to be invariantunder the transformations of Eqs. (6.2.19a)-(6.2.19e)and (6.2.22). Moreover,L2 is invariant under the simul-taneous replacementsU ↔U†, lµ ↔rµ, and χ ↔χ†.
It is said to be of even intrinsic parity.
At lowest order, the effective field theory containstwo parameters F0 and B0. In order to pin down themeaning ofF0, we consider the axial-vector currentJµAaassociated withL2:JµAa = −iF204 Tr(λa{U,∂µU†}). (6.2.25)Expanding U in terms of the field matrixφ, and usingTr(λaλb) = 2 δab results inJµAa = −F0∂µφa + O(φ3), (6.2.26)from which we conclude that the axial-vector currenthas a nonvanishing matrix element when evaluated be-tween the vacuum and a one-Goldstone-boson state:⟨0|JµAa(x)|φb(p)⟩= ipµF0 exp(−ip·x)δab. (6.2.27)Equation (6.2.27) holds at leading order (LO) in ChPT.
It is the current-density analog of Eq. (6.2.12), i.e. , anonvanishing value ofF0 is a necessary and sufficientcriterion for spontaneous symmetry breaking in QCD.
The expansion of the first term of Eq. (6.2.23) inthe field matrixφ yields14Tr(∂µφ∂µφ) + 148F2 Tr([φ,∂µφ][φ,∂µφ]) + ....
(6.2.28)The first term of Eq. (6.2.28) describes the kinetic termof the eight Goldstone bosons and the second term con-tributes to the scattering of Goldstone bosons. The sec-ond term of Eq. (6.2.23) is an example how the ex-plicit symmetry breaking by the quark masses is trans-ferred from the QCD level to the EFT level. Both,L0QCD + Lext and L2 are invariant under local chiraltransformations. Inserting Lext = LM corresponds tos= diag(mu,md,ms) and it is the samesthat is to beused in the effective Lagrangian. The expansion of theχ term gives rise toF20 B0(mu+md+ms)−B02 Tr(φ2M)+2B0Tr(Mφ4)+...
(6.2.29)Even though the first term of Eq. (6.2.29) is of nodynamical significance for the interaction among theGoldstone bosons, it represents an interesting effect. Itsnegative is the energy density of the vacuum,⟨Heﬀ⟩min,whichisshiftedrelativetothechirallimitbecauseofthenonzero quark masses. We compare the partial deriva-tive of⟨Heﬀ⟩min with respect to (any of) the light-quarkmasses ml with the corresponding quantity in QCD,∂⟨0|HQCD|0⟩∂ml⏐⏐⏐⏐mu=md=ms=0= 13⟨0|¯qq|0⟩0 = 13⟨¯qq⟩0,(6.2.30)where⟨¯qq⟩0 isthescalarsingletquarkcondensate.With-intheframeworkofthelowest-ordereffectiveLagrangian,the constant B0 is thus related to the scalar singletquark condensate by3F20 B0 = −⟨¯qq⟩0. (6.2.31)For an overview of recent lattice QCD determinationsof ⟨¯qq⟩0 see Ref. [1573]. Because of the second termof Eq. (6.2.29), the Goldstone bosons are no longermassless. If, for the sake of simplicity, we consider theisospin-symmetric limit mu = md = ˆm (so that thereis no π0-η mixing), we obtain for the masses of theGoldstone bosons, to lowest order in the quark masses(O(q2), denoted by the subscript 2),M2π,2 = 2B0 ˆm, (6.2.32a)M2K,2 = B0( ˆm+ ms), (6.2.32b)M2η,2 = 23B0 ( ˆm+ 2ms) . (6.2.32c)These results, in combination with Eq. (6.2.31), cor-respond to relations obtained in Ref. [1574] and arereferred to as the Gell-Mann, Oakes, and Renner re-lations. Because of the on-shell condition p2 = M2,Eqs.(6.2.32a)-(6.2.32c)justifytheassignment χ= O(q2).
Inserting the empirical valuesMπ = 135 MeV, MK =496 MeV, andMη = 548 MeV for the lowest-order pre-dictions provides a first estimate for the ratio of thequark masses,M2KM2π= ˆm+ ms2 ˆm ⇒msˆm = 25.9, (6.2.33a)M2ηM2π= 2ms + ˆm3 ˆm ⇒msˆm = 24.3. (6.2.33b)6.2 Chiral perturbation theory 209A remarkable feature of Eq. (6.2.23) is the fact that,once F0 is known (from pion decay), chiral symme-try allows us to make absolute predictions about otherprocesses. For example, the lowest-order results for thescattering of Goldstone bosons can be derived straight-forwardly from theO(φ4) contributions of Eqs. (6.2.28)and (6.2.29). In particular, the s-wave ππ-scatteringlengths for the isospin channelsI = 0 and I = 2 areobtained as [1570]a00 = 7M2π32πF2π= 0.160, a 20 = − M2π16πF2π= −0.0456,(6.2.34)where we replacedF0 by the physical pion-decay con-stant and made use of the numerical valuesFπ = 92 .2MeV andMπ = Mπ+ = 139 .57 MeV. These results areidenticalwiththecurrent-algebrapredictionsofRef.[ 22].
Actually, they serve as an illustration of the fact thattheresultsofcurrentalgebracan(moreeasily)berepro-duced from lowest-order perturbation theory in termsof an effective Lagrangian [1575]—in the present casethe lowest-order mesonic ChPT Lagrangian.
However, ChPT is much more powerful than theeffective Lagrangians of the 1960s, which, by defini-tion, were meant to be applied only in lowest-orderperturbation theory (see, e.g., the second footnote inRef. [1576]). In ChPT, a systematic improvement be-yond the tree-level of the lowest-order Lagrangian ofEq. (6.2.23) is accomplished by calculating loop correc-tions in combination with tree-level contributions fromLagrangians of higher order. For a long time it was be-lieved that performing loop calculations using the La-grangian of Eq. (6.2.23) would make no sense, becauseit is not renormalizable (in the traditional sense [821]).
However, as emphasized by Weinberg [1387, 1577], thecancellation of ultraviolet divergences does not reallydepend on renormalizability; as long as one includes ev-ery one of the infinite number of interactions allowed bysymmetries, the so-called non-renormalizable theoriesare actually just as renormalizable as renormalizabletheories [1577]. This still leaves open the question ofhow to organize a perturbative description of observ-ables. For that purpose, one needs a power-countingscheme to assess the importance of various diagramscalculated from the most general effective Lagrangian.
Using Weinberg’s power counting scheme [1387], onemay analyze the behavior of a given diagram of mesonicChPT under a linear re-scaling of allexternal momenta,pi ↦→tpi, and a quadratic re-scaling of the light-quarkmasses, ml ↦→t2ml, which, in terms of the Goldstone-boson masses, corresponds to M2 ↦→t2M2. The chi-ral dimension D of a given diagram with amplitude4 2Fig. 6.2.1 Self-energy diagrams at O(q4). Vertices derivedfrom L2n are denoted by2nin the interaction blobs.
M(pi,ml) is defined byM(tpi,t2ml) = tDM(pi,ml), (6.2.35)where, inn dimensions,D= nNL −2NI +∞∑k=12kN2k (6.2.36)= 2 + ( n−2)NL +∞∑k=12(k−1)N2k (6.2.37)≥2 in 4 dimensions.
Here, NL is the number of independent loops,NI thenumber of internal Goldsone-boson lines, andN2k thenumber of vertices originating from L2k. A diagramwith chiral dimensionD is said to be of orderO(qD).
Clearly, for small enough momenta and masses, dia-grams with smallD, such asD = 2 or D = 4 , shoulddominate. Of course, the re-scaling of Eq. (6.2.35) mustbe viewed as a mathematical tool. While external three-momenta can, to a certain extent, be made arbitrarilysmall, the re-scaling of the quark masses is a theoreticalinstrumentonly.Notethat,for n= 4,loopdiagramsarealways suppressed due to the term2NL in Eq. (6.2.37).
In other words, we have a perturbative scheme in termsof external momenta and masses which are small com-pared to some scale (here4πF0 ≈1 GeV).
The most general Lagrangian at O(q4) was con-structed by Gasser and Leutwyler [64] and containstwelvelow-energyconstants(LECs)( L1,...,L 10,H1H2),L4 = L1{Tr[DµU(DµU)†]}2+ ... + H2Tr(χχ†).
(6.2.38)The numerical values of the low-energy constantsLiare not determined by chiral symmetry. In analogy toF0 and B0 of L2 they are parameters containing infor-mation on the underlying dynamics. For an extensivereview of the status of these coupling constants, seeRefs. [1578] as well as [1573].
As an example of a one-loop calculation let us con-sider theO(q4) corrections to the masses of the Gold-stone bosons. For that purpose one needs to evaluatethe self-energy diagrams shown in Fig.6.2.1. The cor-responding expressions for the masses were first given210 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESin Ref. [64], of which we show the squared pion mass asa representative example:M2π,4 =M2π,2{1 + M2π,232π2F20ln(M2π,2µ2)− M2η,296π2F20ln(M2η,2µ2)+ 16F20[(2 ˆm+ ms)B0(2Lr6 −Lr4) + ˆmB0(2Lr8 −Lr5)]}.
(6.2.39)Because of the overall factorM2π,2, the pion stays mass-less as ml →0. This is, of course, what we expectedfrom QCD in the chiral limit, but it is comforting to seethat the self interaction inL2 (in the absence of quarkmasses) does not generate Goldstone-boson masses athigher order. The ultraviolet divergences generated bythe loop diagram of Fig.6.2.1 are cancelled by a suit-able adjustment of the parameters ofL4. This is Wein-berg’s argument on renormalizability at work; as longas one works with the most general Lagrangian all ul-traviolet divergences can be absorbed in the parametersof the theory. AtO(q4), the squared Goldstone-bosonmasses contain terms which are analytic in the quarkmasses, namely, of the formm2l multiplied by the renor-malized low-energy constants Lri. However, there arealso nonanalytic terms of the typem2l ln(ml)—so-calledchiral logarithms—which do not involve new parame-ters. Such a behavior is an illustration of the mecha-nism found by Li and Pagels [1579], who noticed that aperturbation theory around a symmetry, which is real-ized in the Nambu-Goldstone mode, results in both an-alytic as well as nonanalytic expressions in the pertur-bation. Finally, by construction, the scale dependenceof the renormalized coefficientsLri entering Eq. (6.2.39)is such that it cancels the scale dependence of the chi-ral logarithms [64]. Thus, physical observables do notdepend on the scaleµ.
In terms of Fig.6.2.1 and the result of Eq. (6.2.39),we can also comment on the so-called chiral-symmetry-breakingscale Λχ tobe Λχ = 4πF0 [1566].Inaloopcor-rection, every endpoint of an internal Goldstone-bosonline is multiplied by a factor of1/F0, since the SU(3)matrix of Eq. (6.2.20) contains the Goldstone-bosonfields in the combinationφ/F0. On the other hand, ex-ternal momentaq or Goldstone-boson masses producefactors of q2 or M2 (see Eqs. (6.2.28) and (6.2.29)).
Together with a factor1/(16π2) remaining after inte-gration in four dimensions they combine to correctionsof the order of[q/(4πF0)]2 for each independent loop.
Strictly speaking, this particular integral generates anadditional factor of 2, and the factor of1/(16π2) shouldbe considered an estimate.
The Lagrangians discussed so far are of even intrin-sic parity. AtO(q4), they are incomplete, because theydo not describe processes such asK+K− →π+π−π0or π0 →γγ. The missing piece is the effective Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) action [1580, 1581], which ac-counts for the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly re-sults in the so-called anomalous Ward identities thatgive a particular form to the variation of the gener-ating functional [1570, 1580]. At leading order,O(q4),and in the absence of external fields, the WZW actionreads [1580, 1581],S0ano = NcS0WZW,S0WZW = − i240π2∫ 10dα∫d4xϵijklmTr(ULi ULj ULk ULl ULm).
(6.2.40)For the construction of the WZW action, the domain ofdefinition ofU needs to be extended to a (hypothetical)fifth dimension,U(y) = exp(iαφ(x)F0), (6.2.41)where yi = ( xµ,α), i = 0 ,..., 4, and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.
Minkowski space is defined as the surface of the five-dimensional space for α = 1 . The indices i,...,m inEq. (6.2.40) run from 0 to 4,y4 = y4 = α, ϵijklm isthe completely antisymmetric (five-dimensional) tensorwith ϵ01234 = −ϵ01234 = 1, andULi = U†∂U/∂yi.
In contrast to L2 and L4, S0ano is of odd intrinsicparity,i.e. , it changes sign underφ→−φ. Expandingthe SU(3) matrixU(y) in terms of the Goldstone-bosonfields, U(y) = 1 + iαφ(x)/F0 + O(φ2), one obtains aninfinite series of terms, each involving an odd number ofGoldstone bosons. For example, after some rearrange-ments, the term with the smallest number of Goldstonebosons readsS5φWZW = 1240π2F50∫d4xϵµνρσTr(φ∂µφ∂νφ∂ρφ∂σφ).
(6.2.42)In particular, the WZW action without external fieldsinvolves at least five Goldstone bosons [1580]. Again,once F0 is known, after insertingNc = 3 one obtains aparameter-freepredictionfor,e.g.,theprocess K+K− →π+π−π0.
In the presence of external fields, the anomalous ac-tion receives an additional term [1581–1583]Sano = Nc(S0WZW + SextWZW) (6.2.43)given bySextWZW = − i48π2∫d4xϵµνρσTr[Zµνρσ(U,l,r )−Zµνρσ(1 ,l,r )] . (6.2.44)6.2 Chiral perturbation theory 211where the explicit form ofZµνρσ(U,l,r ) can be found in[1582, 1583]. At leading order, the action of Eq. (6.2.44)is responsible for the two-photon decays of theπ0 or theη. Quantum corrections to the WZW classical actiondo not renormalize the coefficient of the WZW term.
The counter terms needed to renormalize the one-loopsingularities atO(q6) are of a conventional chirally in-variant structure. In the three-flavor sector, the mostgeneral odd-intrinsic-parity Lagrangian atO(q6) con-tains23independentterms[ 1584,1585].Foranoverviewof applications in the odd-intrinsic-parity sector, we re-fer to Ref. [1583].
6.2.3 ChPT for baryonsChPTwasfirstextendedtothebaryonsectorinRef.[ 1586],whichconsideredavarietyofmatrixelementswithsingle-nucleon incoming and outgoing states. While the gen-eralapproachisanalogoustothatinthemesonicsector,i.e. , one considers the most general Lagrangian consis-tent with the symmetries of QCD and expands observ-ables in a quark-mass and low-momentum expansion,the baryon sector exhibits some new features. In par-ticular, unlike the Goldstone-boson masses, the baryonmasses do not vanish in the chirallimit. This has impor-tant consequences for obtaining a proper power count-ing of diagrams containing baryon lines and for theregularization and renormalization of loop diagrams.
In the following we restrict the discussion to SU(2)L ×SU(2)R chiral symmetry; for the extension to SU(3)L×SU(3)R see, e.g., the reviews of Refs. [1587, 1588] andreferences therein. To construct the pion-nucleon La-grangian, the proton (p) and neutron (n) fields are com-bined into an SU(2) doubletΨ,Ψ =(pn). (6.2.45)The nucleon fields are chosen to transform under localSU(2)L ×SU(2)R transformations asΨ →K(VL,VR,U)Ψ, (6.2.46)where the SU(2) matrix K depends on the left- andright-handed transformations as well as on the pionfields collected inU,K(VL,VR,U) =√VRUV †L−1VR√U. (6.2.47)The baryon Lagrangian also contains the covariant de-rivative of the nucleon field given byDµΨ = (∂µ + Γµ −iv(s)µ )Ψ, (6.2.48)with the connection [1586, 1589]Γµ = 12[u†(∂µ −irµ)u+ u(∂µ −ilµ)u†], (6.2.49)where u2 = U, and the isoscalar vector fieldv(s)µ . Fur-ther, it is convenient to defineuµ = i[u†(∂µ −irµ)u−u(∂µ −ilµ)u†]. (6.2.50)The LO Lagrangian can be written as [1586]L(1)πN = ¯Ψ(i/D−m + gA2 γµγ5uµ)Ψ. (6.2.51)It contains two LECs:m and gA. These correspond tothe nucleon mass (m) and the nucleon axial-vector coup-ling constant (gA), both taken in the chiral limit. Thecorresponding physical values will be denoted asmNandgA inthefollowing.Thesuperscript (1) inEq.( 6.2.51)denotes that the Lagrangian is of first order in thepower counting. While neither the nucleon energy northe chiral-limit nucleon mass are small parameters, thecombinationi/D−m can be assumed to be a small quan-tity as long as the nucleon three-momentum isO(q).
This Lagrangian can be used to calculate the firstloopcontributiontothenucleonmass.Thepowercount-ing predicts this contribution to beO(q3). However, theapplication of dimensional regularization and the min-imal subtraction scheme of ChPT (˜MS) as used in themeson sector results in terms that are of lower orderthan predicted by the power counting. Analogous is-sues also arise for other observables and higher-ordercontributions. The authors of Ref. [1586] pointed outthat the failure of the power counting is related to theregularization and renormalization schemes and thatthe “same phenomenon would occur in the meson sec-tor, if one did not make use of dimensional regulariza-tion.” Several methods to address the power countingissue have been proposed [1590–1595].
OnecommonlyusedmethodisHeavyBaryonChPT(HBChPT) [1590], which was inspired by Heavy QuarkEffectiveTheory[ 667,1254](seethediscussioninSec. 6.1).
Because the nucleon mass is large compared to the pionmass, an additional expansion of the pion-nucleon La-grangian is performed in inverse powers of the nucleonmass. In this formalism, application of dimensional reg-ularization in combination with˜MS to loop diagrams,as in the meson sector, leads to a consistent powercounting, connecting the chiral to the loop expansion.
The heavy-baryon Lagrangian up to and including or-der q4 is given in Ref. [1596]. For an introduction to,and applications of, this method see, e.g., Refs. [1587,1597].
While the heavy-baryon formalism makes it possi-ble to use techniques from the meson sector, the addi-tional expansion in powers of the inverse nucleon massresults in a large number of terms in the higher-orderLagrangians.Someofthehigher-ordertermsarerelatedto those at lower orders by Lorentz invariance [1398].212 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESCalculated amplitudes can be expressed in Lorentz-invariant forms, but Lorentz invariance is not manifestthroughout intermediate steps of the calculations. Fur-ther, issues with analyticity arise in some specific casesbecause the heavy-baryon expansion results in a shiftof the poles in the nucleon propagator [1592].
A manifestly Lorentz-invariant approach to baryonChPT that addresses these issues was formulated inRef. [1592], referred to as infrared regularization. Whileinfrared regularization also uses dimensional regular-ization, the renormalization procedure is different fromminimal subtraction. Loop integrals are separated intoinfrared-singular and infrared-regular parts. The infra-red-singular parts contain the same infrared singulari-ties as the original integral and they satisfy the powercounting.Theinfrared-regularpartsareanalyticinsmallparametersforarbitraryspacetimedimensionsandcon-tainthepower-counting-violatingterms.Sincetheinfra-red-regular parts are analytic, they can be absorbed inthe LECs of the baryon Lagrangian. Infrared regular-ization in its original formulation was applicable to one-loop diagrams. It has been widely used in the calcula-tion of baryon properties, see, e.g., Ref. [1598] for areview.
The expansion of the infrared-regular parts in smallparameters contains not only the terms violating thepower counting, but also an infinite set of terms thatsatisfy the power counting. The extended on-mass-shell(EOMS) scheme [1595] provides a method to isolatethe terms that violate the power counting and to ab-sorb only these terms in the LECs of the Lagrangian.
The EOMS scheme was also shown to be applicableto multi-loop diagrams [1599] and diagrams containingparticles other than pions and nucleons [1600]. By re-formulating infrared regularization analogously to theEOMS scheme [1601], it can be applied beyond one-loop pion-nucleon diagrams [1599]; see also Ref. [1602]for a different extension of infrared regularization.
The nucleon mass presents an example of the appli-cation of baryon ChPT. It has been determined to one-loop order in several approaches, including HBChPT[1603], infrared regularization [1592], and the EOMSscheme [1595]. Up to and including orderq3, the chiralexpansion of the nucleon mass is given bymN = m −4c1M2 − 3g2A32πF2 M3 + ..., (6.2.52)where F denotes the pion-decay constant in the two-flavor chiral limit, Fπ = F[1 + O( ˆm)] = 92 .2 MeVand M2 = 2 Bˆm is the lowest-order expression for thesquared pion mass.
The result of Eq. (6.2.52) exhibits some general fea-tures of baryon ChPT: The expansion contains not justevenpowersinthesmallparameter qlikethemesonsec-tor, but also odd powers. As a result, the convergence ofchiral expansions is expected to be slower in the baryonsector. The second-order contribution is proportional tothe LECc1 from the second-order Lagrangian. On theother hand, the coefficient of the nonanalytic term pro-portional to M3 is given entirely in terms of the LOLEC gA and F. Similar features also appear at higherorders. The general form of the chiral expansion of thenucleon mass to higher orders is given bymN = m + k1M2 + k2M3 + k3M4 ln(Mµ)+ k4M4+ k5M5 ln(Mµ)+ k6M5+ k7M6 ln2(Mµ)+ k8M6 ln(Mµ)+ k9M6 + ...,(6.2.53)where µis the renormalization scale and the ellipsis de-notes higher-order terms. The coefficientski are linearcombinations of various LECs.k1 through k4 can bedetermined by considering at most one-loop diagrams,whilek5 throughk9 receive contributions from two-loopdiagrams. Using estimates of the LECs entering theki,Ref. [1604] estimated the nucleon mass in the chirallimit from an EOMS calculation to orderq4 to bem = [938.3 −74.8 + 15 .3 + 4 .7 −0.7] MeV= 882.8 MeV. (6.2.54)Two-loop contributions to orderq5 were considered inRef. [1605], while Refs. [1606, 1607] determinedmN toorder q6. Because several currently undetermined LECsenter the expressions for several of the higher-orderki,no reliable estimate of the complete two-loop contribu-tions is possible. However, the coefficientk5 of the lead-ing nonanalytic contribution at orderq5 only dependson gA and the pion-decay constantF and can thereforebe compared to lower-order terms. At the physical pionmass and withµ= mN, k5M5 ln(M/mN) = −4.8 MeV.
Chiral expansions like that of Eq. (6.2.53) are alsoimportant at nonphysical pion masses in the extrapo-lation of lattice QCD results (for an introduction see,e.g., Ref. [1608]). The fifth-order termk5M5 ln(M/mN)becomes as large as the third-order termk2M3, wherek2 also only depends ongA and F, for a pion mass ofabout 360 MeV. While this comparison includes onlyone part of the two-loop contributions, it indicates alimit to the applicability of the power counting. Thisestimate agrees with others found using different meth-ods in Refs. [1609, 1610].
Even though the nucleon mass is a static quantity,it is not entirely surprising that a combined chiral and6.3 Chiral EFT and nuclear physics 213momentum expansion in the baryon sector does notconverge well for energies beyond about300 MeV. Thisroughly corresponds to the mass gap between the nu-cleon and the∆(1232) resonance. At the physical point,treating the∆as an explicit degree of freedom has lim-ited impact on the nucleon mass [1611, 1612]. How-ever, the∆(1232) also couples strongly to theπN chan-nel and has relatively large photon decay amplitudes,resulting in important contributions to processes suchas pion-nucleon scattering, Compton scattering, andelectromagnetic pion production. These issues werealready pointed out in Ref. [1590], which advocated fortreating ∆ degrees of freedom as dynamic. In baryonChPT with only pions and nucleons as degrees of free-dom, effects of the∆(1232) enter implicitly through thevaluesoftheLECs.However,thesecontributionscanbeproportional to powers ofM/δ, whereδ = ( m∆ −m).
This ratio is small as the quark masses approach thechiral limit, but it is a rather large expansion param-eter at the physical values, especially when combinedwith the strong coupling of the∆. By formulating atheory that also includes the∆ as an active degree offreedom, one hopes to improve the convergence of theperturbative expansion and potentially to increase thekinematic range of applicability.
The inclusion of∆ degrees of freedom poses addi-tional challenges to the construction of the most gen-eral Lagrangian and to the power counting. The co-variant description of spin-32 , isospin-32 fields introducesunphysical degrees of freedom [1613, 1614]. For the freeLagrangian,thesecanbeeliminatedbysubsidiaryequa-tions and projection operators. The correct number ofdegrees of freedom also has to be preserved when in-cluding interactions with pions, nucleons, and externalfields. Various approaches addressing this issue havebeen considered, see, e.g., Refs. [1615–1620].
The main issue for the power counting is how tocount the ∆-nucleon mass differenceδ. In one versionofthepowercounting[ 1617],itisasmallquantityofthesame order as the pion mass,δ ∼O(q). In a differentapproach [1621], it is argued that (for physical quarkmasses) Mπ < δand that Mπ/δ ∼δ/Λ, where Λ ∼1 GeV is the breakdown scale of the EFT. Denoting¯δ ≡δ/Λ implies thatMπ/Λ ∼¯δ2, i.e. , the pion massis of higher order than the∆-nucleon mass differencein this power counting.
6.2.4 ConclusionsOver the last few decades, ChPT has developed into amature and comprehensive approach to the low-energyinteractions between Goldstone bosons, nucleons, andexternal fields, with numerous successful applications.
ChPT has played an important role in interpreting lat-tice QCD calculations performed at unphysical pionmasses. It has also served as a prototype for semi-phenomenological approaches in other systems. Theapplication of ChPT methods to the interactions be-tween two and more nucleons is discussed in the contri-bution by Epelbaum and Pastore.
6.3 Chiral EFT and nuclear physicsEvgeny Epelbaum and Saori PastoreAs explained in the previous section, ChPT allows onetodescribethelow-energyinteractionsbetweenhadronsin the Goldstone-boson and single-baryon sectors bymeansofaperturbativeexpansioninlight-quarkmassesand particle momenta in line with the symmetries ofQCD.Inthissectionwebrieflyreviewtheextensionandapplication of this systematic and model-independentmethod to systems with several baryons, focusing onthenon-strangesector.Thisextensiongoesbeyondstrictperturbation theory and is commonly referred to as chi-ral effective field theory, or ChEFT, in order to makethe distinction with ChPT clear.
6.3.1 The foundations of ChEFTEFT methods enjoy increasing popularity in nuclearphysics63. A unified description of few-nucleon systems,mediummassandheavynucleiaswellasnuclearmatterup to the saturation density calls for an EFT applicableat nucleon momentap ∼Mπ, which must include pi-ons as dynamical DoF. The corresponding framework,commonly referred to as chiral EFT (ChEFT), was pi-oneered by Weinberg [1626, 1627] and represents the63 In the past decades, a variety of EFTs utilizing differentdegrees of freedom (DoF) have been developed to describe phe-nomena characterized by specific energy scales. For example,an EFT description of rotational bands of deformed heavy nu-clei with excitation energies E ≪ 1 MeV can be efficientlyachieved in terms of collective coordinates with no need to re-solve the internal structure of a nucleus under consideration[1622]. Low-energy properties of nuclei consisting of a densecore, surrounded by weakly bound nucleons, have been stud-ied in halo-EFT [1623]. This framework treats the core nucleusas a point-like particle and utilizes the expansion in powersof p/pcore, with p and pcore denoting the binding momentaof the nucleons and of the core nucleus, respectively. AnotherEFT approach, the so-called pion-less EFT, is formulated interms of nucleons as the only dynamical DoF and is well suitedto describe the dynamics of few-nucleon systems at momentap≪ Mπ. This framework has proven to be particularly efficientfor uncovering universal features of few-body systems aroundthe unitary limit [1624, 1625].214 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESmost widely used EFT approach in nuclear physics ap-plications. The method relies on the spontaneously bro-ken approximate chiral symmetry of QCD and makesuse of the effective Lagrangian for pions and nucleonsalready introduced in the previous section. Specifically,the O(q2) and O(q4) mesonic Lagrangians are givenin Eqs. (6.2.23) and (6.2.38), respectively, while the LOpion-nucleon(πN)LagrangianiswritteninEq.( 6.2.51).
Mostoftheapplicationstofew-nucleonsystemsarecar-ried out using the heavy-baryon (HB) Lagrangian forthevelocity-dependentnucleonfield N(x) = eimv·xP+v Ψ(x),with P+v = (1 + v·γ)/2 being the velocity projectionoperator [1590]. The LO HBπN Lagrangian obtainedfrom the covariant expression in Eq. (6.2.51) takes theformL(1)πN = N†(iv·D+ gAS·u)N, (6.3.1)where Sµ = −γ5[γµ, γν]vν/4 is the covariant spin-ope-rator that is given by the usual Pauli matricesSµ =(0, ⃗ σ/2) in the rest-frame system of the nucleon withvµ = (1 ,⃗0 ). Higher-order terms in the HB πN La-grangian can be found in Refs. [1587,1596]. Finally, onealso needs to include in the effective Lagrangian termswith more than two nucleon fields. The correspondingLO Lagrangian has the form [1626, 1627]L(0)NN = −12CS(N†N)2 + 2CTN†SµNN †SµN, (6.3.2)with CS, CT being low-energy constants (LECs).
While both ChPT and ChEFT rely on the same ef-fective Lagrangian, the two frameworks are applied todescribe rather different phenomenological situations.
Contrary to the meson and single-baryon sectors, thescattering amplitudes for few-nucleon systems exhibitlow-lying poles corresponding to bound (and virtual)states, which signal the breakdown of perturbation the-ory at very low momenta. For example, in the3S1 and1S0 channels of neutron-proton scattering, the poles arelocated at pcms ∼45i MeV andpcms ∼−8i MeV, re-spectively, which is well within the validity domain ofchiral (and even pion-less) EFT. This is in strong con-trasttopion-pionscattering,wherethelowest-lyingres-onances reside at momenta of the order of the break-down scale of ChPT, and the scattering amplitude ad-mits a perturbative expansion in powers of momentafor p ∼ Mπ. It is worth emphasizing that while thespontaneously broken chiral symmetry of QCD leads toa strong suppression of the interactions between Gold-stone bosons (pions) at low energy, which is at the heartof ChPT, it does not constrain the strength of the inter-action between the nucleons for|⃗ p|→ 0, see Eq. (6.3.2).
So how can ChEFT be reconciled with the nonper-turbative nature of the two-nucleon interaction? To an-swer this question one needs a power-counting schemethat determines the importance ofrenormalized contri-butions to the scattering amplitude. The power count-ing of mesonic ChPT was already given in Eqs. (6.2.35)-(6.2.37). Using the HB framework to avoid the appear-anceofpositivepowersofthenucleonmassinrenormal-ized expressions as explained in the previous section,the power counting can be straightforwardly extendedtosingle-andfew-nucleonscatteringamplitudes.Acon-nected contribution to the scattering amplitude forNnucleons with generic momenta|⃗ p|∼ Mπ involvingNLindependent loop integrals is found to scale asM∼ qD,where q ∈{|⃗ p|/Λb, Mπ/Λb}with Λb being the break-down scale of ChEFT. In four space-time dimensions,the powerD is given by [1626, 1627]D= 2 −N + 2NL +∑iVi∆i, (6.3.3)whereVi denotes the number of vertices of typei, whosedimension ∆i is given by∆i = −2 + 12ni + di. (6.3.4)Here,ni isthenumberofnucleonfieldswhile di referstothe number of derivatives and/or insertions ofMπ. Us-ing Eq. (6.3.3), one can draw the relevant Feynman dia-grams contributing to the multi-nucleon scattering am-plitudeatincreasingordersinchiralEFT,seeFig. 6.3.1.
The terms LO, NLO, N2LO, N3LO and N4LO refer tothe ChEFT orders q0, q2, q3, q4 and q5, respectively.
Notice that contributions at orderq1 are forbidden byparity conservation. However, the above classificationof Feynman diagrams implies a perturbative nature ofmulti-nucleon scattering amplitudes, which is in con-tradiction with the empirical evidence. The key insightof Weinberg was the observation that certain contri-butions to the amplitude are enhanced beyond whatis expected based on Eq. (6.3.3) [1626, 1627]. Consider,for example, the two-pion exchange planar box diagram(the last diagram in the second line of Fig.6.3.1):M= i∫ d4l1(2π)4 li1lj1lk2 ll2 ˆOijklil21 −M2π + iϵil22 −M2π + iϵ× 2im(p1 −l1)2 −m2 + iϵ2im(p2 + l1)2 −m2 + iϵ,(6.3.5)where pµ1 = (√⃗ p2 + m2, ⃗ p) and pµ2 = (√⃗ p2 + m2, −⃗ p)are the initial four-momenta of the nucleons, l1 andl2 = p′1 −p1 + l1 are pion momenta and we have usedthe relativistic rather than the strict HB expressions forthe nucleon propagators for reasons to be given below.

the renormalized amplitude for the box diagram is ex-pected to be of the order ofM ∼M2π in agreementwith the power counting formula in Eq. (6.3.3). On theother hand, performing the integration overl01 using theresidue theorem, one obtainsM=∫ d3l1(2π)3ˆOijkl[li1lj1ω21m⃗ p2 −(⃗ p−⃗l1)2 + iϵlk2 ll2ω22+ ω21 + ω1ω2 + ω222ω31ω32(ω1 + ω2) li1lj1lk2 ll2 + O(1m)], (6.3.6)whereωi =√⃗l2i + M2π aretheenergiesoftheexchangedpions. Remarkably, the first term in the square brack-ets is enhanced by the factorm/Mπ compared to thepower counting estimation. The origin of this enhance-ment can be traced back to the pinch singularity in them →∞ limit [1626, 1627], which is why we used therelativistic expressions for the nucleon propagators64.
Notice that infrared divergences of this kind do not ap-pear in the single-baryon sector of ChPT.
To identify all enhanced types of contributions tothe amplitude it is useful to recall that performing theintegration over l0 leads to a decomposition of Feyn-man diagrams into a sum of diagrams emerging in old-fashioned time-ordered perturbation theory (TOPT).
Indeed, the first (enhanced) term in the square brackets64 This singularity is the basis of the covariant spectator the-ory discussed in Sec.5.3.
in Eq. (6.3.6) stems from two-nucleon-reducible TOPTdiagrams which have an intermediate state involvingtwo nucleons and no pions. Energy denominators asso-ciated with such purely nucleonic intermediate states ofTOPT diagrams involve only nucleon kinetic energies∼M2π/m≪Mπ and are smaller than what is expectedfrom NDA. This leads to the enhancement of reducible-type diagrams beyond the power counting estimationin Eq. (6.3.3)65. In contrast, the second term in thesquare brackets of Eq. (6.3.6) emerges from irreducibletwo-pion exchange diagrams with intermediate statesinvolving at least one pion and results in the contribu-tion M∼ M2π in agreement with Eq. (6.3.3).
In his seminal work [1626, 1627], Weinberg has ar-gued that the breakdown of perturbation theory forthe scattering amplitude in the few-nucleon sector ofChEFT can be traced back to the enhancement of re-ducible diagrams, which need to be resummed to all or-ders. He also noticed that ladder-type reducible TOPTdiagrams automatically get resummed by solving theLippmann-Schwinger-typeintegralequationsfortheam-plitudeM= V + VG0M= V + VG0V + VG0VG0V + ... .
Indeed, the terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.3.6)can be easily identified with the iterated one-pion ex-65 Reducible and irreducible diagrams also play a central rolein the derivation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation; see Sec.5.3.216 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESchange potential (OPEP) and the leading two-pion ex-change potential (TPEP),M= V1πG0V1π + V2π + ... .
Thus, low-energy processes involving several nucleonscan be calculated in a systematically improvable way byapplyingChPTtothekernelofthedynamicalequation,defined as a sum of all possible few-nucleon-irreducibletime-ordered diagrams, rather than to the scatteringamplitude. The contributions to the nuclear forces de-picted in Fig.6.3.1 are to be understood as (sums of)thecorrespondingfew-nucleon-irreducibletime-ordered-like graphs rather than Feynman diagrams. Switchingon external classical sources in the effective Lagrangianas explained in the previous section, the same frame-work can be used to derive nuclear current operatorsand to analyze low-energy electroweak processes (seethe discussion below).
It is worth emphasizing that the enhancement ofreducible diagrams mentioned above is insufficient tojustify the need for a non-perturbative resummation ofthe amplitude if one countsm∼Λb as done in ChPT.
For example, the iterated OPEP contributes at orderV1πG0V1π ∼mMπ/Λ2b (assuming that all intermediatemomenta are∼Mπ after renormalization) and is thussuppressed relative to the tree-level termV1π = O(1).
To have a self-consistent non-perturbative approach,Weinberg proposed an alternative counting scheme forthe nucleon mass by assigning m ∼ Λ2b/Mπ ≫ Λb,which is supported by the large-Nc arguments giventhat Λb ∼Mρ = O(1) while m= O(Nc). On the otherhand, it is shown in Ref. [1628] that Weinberg’s powercounting can be realized via a suitable choice of renor-malization conditions with no need to depart from thestandard ChPT counting for the nucleon mass, see alsoRef. [1629] for a related discussion.
Weinberg’spowercountingsuggeststhattheLOpo-tential stemming from the derivativeless contact inter-actions∝CS,T,seeEq. (6.3.2),andthe OPEPasshownin Fig.6.3.1has to be iterated to all orders. For the con-tact interactions alone, the scattering amplitude result-ing from solving the Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equa-tion can be calculated analytically and is renormaliz-able in the usual sense66. In contrast, iterations of theOPEP in spin-triplet channels lead to ultraviolet diver-gences whose cancellation requires counterterms withan increasing power of momenta. This feature, alongwith the numerical nature of the calculations in thepresence of the OPEP, make renormalization of chiralEFT a complicated matter; see Ref. [1630] for a collec-tion of perspectives.
66 That is, all ultraviolet divergences emerging from the iter-ations of the LS equation can be absorbed into a redefinition ofCS,T.
Notice that the existence of shallow bound statesalone does not necessarily imply a nonperturbative na-ture of the OPEP, but merely indicates a fine tuning ofthe LECs CS,T [1627, 1631]. An alternative approachbased on a perturbative treatment of the OPEP wasproposed by Kaplan, Savage and Wise (KSW) in thelateninetiesofthelastcentury[ 1632,1633].Thisframe-work allows one to compute the NN scattering ampli-tude analytically and to implement the renormaliza-tion program in a straightforward way with no needto introduce a finite cutoff. However, extensive calcu-lations performed in the KSW approach have revealedpoor convergence (at least) in certain spin-triplet chan-nels [1634, 1635], see also [1636–1638] for a related dis-cussion, indicating that the OPEP should indeed betreated nonperturbatively in low partial waves.
The most advanced applications of chiral EFT tonuclearsystemsarecarriedoututilizingthefinite-cutoffformulation of Ref. [1639]. In essence, it amounts tosolving the quantum-mechanical A-body problem us-ing the nuclear potentials calculated in ChPT and reg-ularized with some finite cutoffΛ taken of the order ofΛ ∼Λb. The calculated scattering amplitudes are im-plicitly renormalized by tuning the bare LECsCS(Λ),CT(Λ), etc., of multi-nucleon vertices to low-energy ob-servables. The resulting (renormalized) scattering am-plitudes depend on the physical parameters and thecutoff Λ. The residualΛ-dependence of the calculatedobservables is expected to introduce an uncertainty be-yond the order one is working at and offers a non-trivial a posteriori consistency check. For more detailson the foundations and applications of the finite-cutoffformulation of chiral EFT see Refs. [1639, 1640]. Fi-nally, a first step towards a formal renormalizabilityproof of the finite-cutoff scheme to all orders in theiterated OPEP using the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann (BPHZ) subtraction technique can be fo-und in Ref. [1641].
6.3.2 Nuclear interactions from ChEFTIn ChPT, the S-matrix is usually obtained by apply-ing the Feynman graph technique to the effective chiralLagrangian. To derive nuclear forces, it is more naturaland convenient to employ non-covariant old-fashionedperturbation theory as already mentioned above. Thisapproach is based on the Hamiltonian rather than La-grangian, so the first step amounts to using the canon-ical formalism for constructing the HamiltonianH =H0 + HI for interacting pions and nucleons from theeffective chiral Lagrangian [1626, 1627]. The NN scat-tering amplitude between the initial and final states|i⟩6.3 Chiral EFT and nuclear physics 217and |f⟩, respectively, can be written as⟨f|M|i⟩= ⟨f|HI∞∑n=0( 1Ei −H0 + iϵHI)n|i⟩, (6.3.7)where Ei is the energy of the nucleons in the state|i⟩.
Notice that the intermediate states in the above equa-tion include both pions and nucleons. Letη and λ de-note the projection operators on the purely nucleonicsubspace and the rest of the Fock space, respectively.
Eq. (6.3.7) can be cast into the form of the LS equation⟨f|M|i⟩= ⟨f|V∞∑n=0( ηEi −H0 + iϵV)n|i⟩, (6.3.8)where the potentialV can e.g. be chosen in the energy-dependent form as done in Refs. [1626, 1627, 1642,1643]:V(Ei) = ηHI∞∑n=0( λEi −H0 + iϵHI)nη. (6.3.9)The explicit energy dependence ofV is a higher-ordereffect, see e.g. Eq. (6.3.6), and can be eliminated yield-ing an energy independent hermitian NN potential. Themethod can be applied to many-body forces and hasalso been used to derive nuclear currents starting fromthe effective Lagrangian with external sources.
It is important to keep in mind that nuclear poten-tials, in contrast to the on-shell amplitude⟨f|M|i⟩, arenotdirectlyobservableandrepresentscheme-dependentquantities. This intrinsic ambiguity reflects the arbi-trariness in making off-shell extensions of the scatter-ing amplitude. Clearly, such off-shell ambiguities can-not lead to measurable effects. Being a quantum-field-theory-basedmethod,chiralEFTbyconstructionmain-tains consistency between many-body interactions andcurrent operators and ensures that calculated observ-ables are independent of the off-shell ambiguities (upto higher-order corrections).
The method of deriving nuclear forces and currentsby matching to the scattering amplitude as outlinedabove was used e.g. in Refs. [1644–1648] and is usu-ally referred to as TOPT. Another closely related ap-proach amounts to block-diagonalizing the pion-nucle-on Hamiltonian via a suitable unitary transformation[1649]H →H′ = U†HU =(ηH′η 00 λH′λ). (6.3.10)Both the unitary operator U and the nuclear poten-tial V = η(H′ −H0)η are calculated perturbatively us-ing the standard power counting of ChPT as explainedin Ref. [1650]. The method of unitary transformation(MUT) to derive nuclear forces and currents was ap-plied e.g. in Refs [1651–1659]. A pedagogical discussionof methods outlined above can be found in Ref. [1660].
So far, we have left out renormalization of nuclearpotentials.Incontrasttothescatteringamplitude,renor-malizability of nuclear forces and currents derived inChPT is not guaranteed by construction and was shownto impose severe constraints on their off-shell behaviorstarting from N3LO [1650, 1655, 1657–1659, 1661].
Having introduced various methods to derive nu-clear potentials from the effective chiral Lagrangian, weare now in the position to discuss the ChEFT expan-sion of the long-range NN force. The one- and two-pionexchange contributions up to N2LO depend solely onthe momentum transfer⃗ qand are, therefore, local. Theresulting potentials have a clear and intuitive interpre-tation in coordinate space. Using the decompositionV(⃗ r) = VC(r) + VS(r)⃗ σ1 ·⃗ σ2 + VT(r)S12 (6.3.11)+[WC(r) + WS(r)⃗ σ1 ·⃗ σ2 + WT(r)S12]⃗ τ1 ·⃗ τ2 ,where S12 = 3⃗ σ1 ·ˆr⃗ σ2 ·ˆr−⃗ σ1 ·⃗ σ2 is the tensor operatorwhile ⃗ τi refer to the isospin Pauli matrices of the nu-cleon i, the LO contribution due to the OPEP is givenbyW(0)T,1π(r) = g2A48πF2πe−xr3 (3 + 3 x+ x2) ,W(0)S,1π(r) = g2AM2π48πF2πe−xr , (6.3.12)wherethesuperscriptofthepotentialsgivestheChEFTorder. Further,x ≡Mπr while gA and Fπ denote thephysical values of the nucleon axial-vector coupling andpion decay constant, respectively. Notice that only theW(0)T,1π(r) ∝r−3 part of the tensor potential survivesin the chiral limit ofMπ →0. It is precisely this sin-gular interaction that leads to the already mentionednon-renormalizability of the OPEP in all spin-tripletchannels of NN scattering. The NLO contributions tothelong-rangeNNinteractionstemfromtheTPEPandare given by [1642, 1644, 1649, 1662]:W(2)C,2π(r) = Mπ128π3F4π1r4{K1(2x)×[1 + 2 g2A(5 + 2 x2) −g4A(23 + 12 x2)]+ xK0(2x)[1 + 10 g2A −g4A(23 + 4 x2)]},V(2)T,2π(r) = − g4AMπ128π3F4π1r4×{12xK0(2x) + (15 + 4 x2)K1(2x)},V(2)S,2π(r) = g4AMπ32π3F4π1r4×{3xK0(2x) + (3 + 2 x2)K1(2x)},(6.3.13)218 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESwhere K0,1(x) denote the modified Bessel functions.
To arrive at these expressions, one first needs to eval-uate the three-dimensional loop integrals for the cor-responding TOPT diagrams67 using e.g. dimensionalregularization. The resultingp-space potentials cannotbe Fourier transformed to r-space directly since theFourier integrals diverge at high momenta. Eq. (6.3.13)is obtained by Fourier transforming the regularized mo-mentum-space potentials and subsequently removingthe regulator.
Similarly, at N2LO, the TPEP receives contribu-tions given by [1644, 1649]V(3)C,2π(r) = 3g2A32π2F4πe−2xr6{2c1x2(1 + x)2+ c3(6 + 12 x+ 10x2 + 4x3 + x4)},W(3)T,2π(r) = − g2Ac448π2F4πe−2xr6 (1 + x)(3 + 3 x+ x2),W(3)S,2π(r) = g2Ac448π2F4πe−2xr6 (1 + x)(3 + 3 x+ 2x2),(6.3.14)where ci are LECs accompanying the subleadingππNNvertices with∆= 1.
TheexpressionsfortheOPEPandTPEP,Eqs.( 6.3.12)to (6.3.14), illustrate the general features of the chiralexpansion of the long-range nuclear interactions:– The chiral expansion of theN-pion exchange poten-tial generally corresponds to the expansion in pow-ers ofMπ/Λχ, where the chiral symmetry breakingscale Λχ is given by 4πFπ and/or the scale thatgoverns the πN LECs starting from the sublead-ing ones. The expansion pattern is the same as forChPT in the meson and single-baryon sectors. Thechiral expansion forV(⃗ r) is expected to converge atdistances r≳ 1/Mπ and larger. In contrast, at shortdistances r ≪1/Mπ, the expansion diverges yield-ing highly singular van der Waals-like behaviourV(s)Nπ(⃗ r) ∼1/r3+s; see also Ref. [1663] for furtherinsights and examples. In the finite-cutoff formula-tion of chiral EFT, this unphysical short-distancebehavior is removed by the regulator.
– Since all relevant πN LECs can nowadays be re-liably determined from the pion-nucleon scatteringamplitude in the subthreshold region, obtained fromthe dispersive Roy-Steiner-equation analysis [1664–1666], ChEFT yields parameter-free predictions forthe long-range behavior of the nuclear forces andcurrents. These predictions are model-independentandrepresentnon-trivialmanifestationsofthespon-taneously broken chiral symmetry of QCD.
67 E.g., the second term in the square brackets in Eq. (6.3.6)gives the TPEP∝ g4A stemming from the last diagram in thesecond row of Fig.6.3.1 (planar box diagram).
– Eqs. (6.3.12)-(6.3.14) also point towards some lim-itations of ChPT, which relies on NDA and can-not capture possible enhancements due to large di-mensionless prefactors. In the NN sector, this espe-cially affects the N2LO contributions to the TPEP.
The corresponding triangle diagram, see Fig.6.3.1,leads to the contribution enhanced by a factor of4π relative to what is expected based on the powercounting, so thatΛχ is in this case better estimatedas Λχ ∼√4πFπ than Λχ ∼4πFπ. Enhancementsof this kind are also not uncommon in the single-nucleon sector of ChPT. For the subleading centralpotential V(3)C,2π(r), this enhancement combines withthe large numerical coefficients and a large value ofthe LECc3 driven by the intermediate∆(1232) ex-citation [1667]. Altogether, this results inV(3)C,2π(r)being by far the dominant TPE component, whosestrength is comparable to that of the OPEP evenat r ∼2 fm. The strongly attractive nature of theisoscalar central potential at intermediate distancesissupportedbyphenomenologyandoftenattributedto theσ-meson exchange in traditional nuclear phy-sics jargon. The chiral expansion of the TPEP hasbeen extended to N4LO [1668–1670] and even be-yondandwasshowntoyieldconvergedresults[ 1671,1672].
The current status of the derivation of nuclear po-tentials in ChEFT is visualized in Fig.6.3.168, see Refs.
[1673, 1674] for comprehensive review articles. On thequalitative level, ChEFT provides a justification of theobserved hierarchy of nuclear forces withV2N ≫V3N ≫V4N ≫... [1626, 1627].
The leading contributions to the three-nucleon force(3NF) at N2LO have been known for a long time [1675,1676]. The expressions for the N3LO and (most of the)N4LO corrections have been worked out in Refs. [1651–1654, 1677–1679]. The four-nucleon force is further sup-pressed relative to the 3NF and appears first at N3LO[1650, 1661]. Isospin-breaking as well as parity- andtime-reversal-violatingnuclearpotentialshavealsobeenworkedout,seeRefs.[ 1673,1680]andreferencestherein.
ThefirstapplicationofChEFTtostudynuclearcur-rent operators goes back to the pioneering papers byPark et al. [1681, 1682]. In the past decade, the vector[1645–1647, 1655, 1656, 1658], axial-vector [1648, 1657],pseudoscalar [1657] and scalar [1659, 1683] current op-erators have been worked out to the leading one-loop-order accuracy for the two-body contributions (i.e., toN3LO using the counting scheme withm ∼Λ2b/Mπ).
As an example, the ChEFT expansion of the electro-68 In some approaches, NN contact interactions are promotedto orders different than those derived by NDA.6.3 Chiral EFT and nuclear physics 219Single-nucleon current Two-nucleon current Three-nucleon currentLONLON2LON3LO ……………… ……/uni23E4/uni23E4/uni23E4/uni23E4/uni23E4Fig. 6.3.2Diagrams contributing to the single-, two- and three-nucleon electromagnetic current operators at lowest orders of chiralEFT using the counting scheme withm∼ Λ2b/Mπ.

magnetic nuclear currents is shown in Fig.6.3.2. Simi-larly to the case of the nuclear forces, the chiral powercounting leads, in general, to a suppression of many-body operators. On the other hand, the leading contri-butions to the single- and two-nucleon current densityboth appear at NLO. In contrast, the exchange chargedensitycontributionsarestronglysuppressedrelativetothe LO term (the charge operator of the nucleon), withboth two- and three-nucleon contributions appearing atN3LO. A comprehensive review of nuclear currents inChEFT, including a detailed comparison of results ob-tained by different groups and a thorough discussionof the differences between them, can be found in Ref.
[1684].
All results described above are based on the effec-tive chiral Lagrangian involving pions and nucleons asthe only explicit DoF. As already emphasized in theprevious section, given the low excitation energy of the∆-resonance and its strong coupling to theπN system,it might be advantageous to also treat the∆DoF as dy-namic. This formulation of ChEFT was already appliedto derive the NN force and most of the 3NF contribu-tions up through N3LO [1643, 1685–1688]. The explicittreatment of the∆leads to a reshuffling of certain con-tributions to lower orders in the EFT expansion. In par-ticular, a part of the unnaturally strong N2LO TPEPis shifted to NLO, and the LECsc3,4 take more natu-ral numerical values [1666]. These results indeed sup-porttheexpectedbetterconvergencepatternofChEFTwith explicit∆ DoF.
Last but not least, ChEFT has also been extendedto the SU(3) sector and applied to study the inter-actions between nucleons and hyperons, see e.g. Refs.
[1689–1691] and Ref. [1692] for a recent review article.
6.3.3 ApplicationsAs already pointed out, nuclear interactions derived inChEFT are singular at short distances and need to beregularized prior to solving the dynamical equation. Abroad range of regulators featuring different functionaldependence on momenta and relative distances havebeen proposed in the literature, see Refs. [1672, 1693–1697] for some examples and Ref. [1698] for a relateddiscussion. For the long-range OPEP and TPEP, it isadvantageous to use a local regularization in order topreserve the analytic structure of the amplitude [1672,1696]. For short-range terms, angle-independent non-local regulators maintain a one-to-one correspondencebetween the plane-wave and partial-wave bases, whichsimplifiesthedeterminationofthecorrespondingLECs.
This choice is utilized in both available N4LO imple-mentations of the NN potentials [1672, 1699] which,however, differ in their way of regularizing the long-220 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESrange terms. In both cases, the LECs accompanyingthe NN short-range interactions were determined solelyfrom the neutron-proton and proton-proton data. Al-ternative fitting strategies, which include informationabout light and medium-mass nuclei and even nuclearmatter, are also being explored [1700].
TheveryaccurateandpreciseNNpotentialsof[ 1672,1701], derived in chiral EFT with pions and nucleonsas the only active DoF, provide an outstanding descrip-tion of NN data up to the pion production threshold69.
In fact, the results of Ref. [1701] comprise a full-fledgedpartial wave analysis of NN scattering data based solelyon chiral EFT. For more details and comparison be-tween different NN potentials see Ref. [1702].
To give an impression about the convergence pat-tern of ChEFT consider the total cross section for neut-ron-proton scattering atElab = 100 MeV as a represen-tative example. Using the potentials from Ref. [1701]one obtains for the cutoffΛ= 450 MeV (in mb)σtot = 84.0[q0]−10.2[q2]+0.4[q3]−0.4[q4]+0.6[q5]−0.0[q6],wherethelasttermgivesthecontributionoftheorder- q6F-wave contact interactions. Given that the expansionparameter is q = pcms/Λb ∼1/3, where we have usedΛb = 650 MeV [1696, 1703, 1704], one observes thatthe order-q3 and q4 contributions appear to be smaller,while the order-q5 correction is somewhat larger thannaively expected. The truncation error of the calculatedvalue can be estimated using a Bayesian approach byinferringtheinformationabouttheconvergencepatternof the ChEFT from the results at all available orders[1703]; see also Ref. [1696] for a related earlier work.
Using the Bayesian model from Ref. [1705], the N4LOtruncation error for the case at hand is estimated to beδσtot = 0 .14 mb at68% confidence level. The final re-sult then readsσtot = 74 .35(14)(17)(1) mb, where thelast two errors refer to the statistical error and uncer-tainty in theπN LECs.
The sub-percent accuracy level of ChEFT has alsobeen reached for other low-energy observables in theNNsector[ 1702].Inparticular,thechargeandquadrupoleform factors of the deuteron were analyzed to N4LO inRefs. [1706, 1707]. The predicted value for the deuteronstructure radius, rstr = 1 .9729+0.0015−0.0012 fm, was used,in combination with the very precise measurement ofthe charge radius difference between2H and the proton[1708], to determine the neutron radius. The obtainedvalueofthequadrupolemoment Qd = 0.2854+0.0038−0.0017 fm2[1707]isinaverygoodagreementwiththespectroscopydetermination Qd = 0.285699(15)(18) fm2 [1709].
69 This requires the inclusion of four order-q6 contact interac-tions that contribute to F-waves [1672, 1699].
The spontaneously broken approximate chiral sym-metry of QCD, together with the experimental informa-tion about theπN system, allow one to predict the long-range behavior of the nuclear forces. In the NN sector,these predictions have been verified from experimentaldata. For example, the only order-q3 contribution tothe NN force comes from the TPEP in Eqs. (6.3.14)(since the contact interactions contribute at ordersq2i,i = 0 ,1,2,... ). Adding these parameter-free contribu-tions to the potential was demonstrated to very signifi-cantly improve the description of the data [1696, 1710,1711]. A similar improvement is observed by adding theorder-q5 TPEP [1670, 1672, 1712]. It is also worth men-tioning that the potentials of [1672] achieve a compara-ble precision to that of the available high-precision phe-nomenological potentials while having a much smallernumber of adjustable parameters70 This is yet anotherevidence of the important role played by chiral symme-try. Finally, the convergence of the chiral EFT expan-sion can be further improved by the inclusion of∆’s asexplicit DoF of the theory. This is supported by the re-cently developed Norfolk chiral many-body interactions[1713]; see also Ref. [1714] for a related discussion.
Beyond the two-nucleon system, the results are pre-sently limited to the N2LO accuracy level due to thelack ofconsistently regularized many-body interactionsand exchange currents starting from N3LO. As dis-cussed in Refs. [1640, 1684, 1702], using dimensionalregularization in the derivation of nuclear interactionsincombinationwithacutoffregularizationoftheSchrö-dinger equation leads, in general, to violations of chiralsymmetry. This issue affects all loop contributions tothe 3NF and exchange current operators, which there-fore need to be re-derived using symmetry-preservingcutoff regularization.
At the N2LO level, the results for three-nucleonscattering observables [1705, 1715–1717] and the spec-tra of light- and medium-mass nuclei [1715, 1717–1724]are mostly consistent with experimental data within er-rors; see also Refs. [1725, 1726] for review articles. As arepresentative example, we show in Fig.6.3.3 the cal-culated ground state energies of p-shell nuclei from Ref.
[1715].
ChEFT interactions and associated currents havebeen vigorously utilized in the past ten years to studyboth static and dynamical electroweak properties of nu-clei, including electromagnetic form factors[860, 1707,1728], electromagnetic moments[1728–1730], electrowe-ak decays[1731, 1732], and low-energy reactions such aselectroweak captures[1733,1734].

lations. For example, a long standing under-prediction[1736] of the measured9C magnetic moment by less so-phisticated theoretical calculations is explained by the∼40% correction generated by two-body electromag-netic currents in Ref. [1735]. This enhancement canbe appreciated in Fig. 6.3.4 by comparing blue dots(representing calculations based on the single nucleonparadigm) and red diamonds (representing calculationswith two-body electromagnetic currents).
Axial currents are tested primarily in beta decaysand electron capture processes for which data are read-ily available and known for the most part with greataccuracy. The long-standing problem of the systematicover-prediction of Gamow-Teller beta decay matrix el-ements [1738] in simplified nuclear calculations, alsoknown as the ‘gA problem’, has been recently addressedby several groups [1732, 1737, 1739]. The authors ofRefs. [1732, 1737] calculated the Gamow-Teller matrixelements inA= 6 −10 nuclei accounting systematicallyfor many-body effects in nuclear interactions and cou-pling to the axial current, both derived in ChEFT. Theagreement of the calculations with the data is excellentfor A = 3 ,6 and 7 systems, with two-body currentsproviding a small (∼2%) contribution to the matrixelements. Decays in theA= 8 and 10 systems, instead,require further developments of the nuclear wave func-tions [1737, 1739]. The ‘gA-problem’ can be resolved inlight nuclei largely by correlation effects in the nuclearwave functions. A summary of these calculations is re-ported in Fig.6.3.5. Similar results for these light nucleiobtained using the No-core shell model are reported inRef. [1739].222 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIES150123|MGT| Experiment34P1 !34S024Na4 !24Mg433P1/2 !33S3/234P1 !34S024Ne0 !24Na128Al3 !28Si230Mg0 !30Al126Na3 !26Mg237K3/2 !37Ar3/225Al5/2 !25Mg5/237K3/2 !37Ar5/219Ne1/2 !19F1/2bare ⌧ ⌧(SRG+IMSRG) ⌧+ 2BCq =1q =0.80(3)q =0.89(4)q =0.96(6)0 1 2 3|MGT| Theory (unquenched)0123|MGT| Experiment46Sc4 !46Ti445Ti7/2 !45Sc7/247Sc7/2 !47Ti7/247V3/2 !47Ti5/245V7/2 !45Ti5/243Sc7/2 !43Ca5/245Ti7/2 !45Sc7/245V7/2 !45Ti7/242Ti0 !42Sc142Sc7 !42Ca6bare ⌧ ⌧(SRG+IMSRG) ⌧+ 2BCq =1q =0.78(3)q =0.85(3)q =0.92(4)FIG. 10.

See Ref. [1739] for details.
The ChEFT approach is also being implemented instudies of medium-mass nuclei [1739]. As a represen-tative of this class of electroweak calculations we showthe results of Ref. [1739] on beta decay matrix elementsvisualized in Fig.6.3.6. Here, the authors demonstratethatthequenchinginthenuclearmatrixelementsarisesprimarily from ChEFT axial two-body currents andstrong correlations in the nucleus. Nuclei fromA = 3to 100Sn are calculated based on ChEFT in agreementwith experimental data.
To summarize, there has been exceptional progressin studying nuclear physics using ChEFT. In the lasttwo decades this framework, rooted in the symmetriesof QCD and their breaking pattern, has allowed forthe calculation of many low-energy nuclear processes,such as electromagnetic reactions andβ decays in bothlight and medium-mass nuclei, has reached a remark-able agreement with experiment, and has contributedto solving long-standing anomalies in nucleartheory. Aschiral interactions and currents are being refined andpushed to higher orders, we have entered the precisionera of this powerful framework.
6.3.4 Connections to lattice QCDLattice QCD (LQCD) offers a first-principles approachto study hadronic and nuclear systems. Several LQCDgroups have studied baryon-baryon systems as well aslight (hyper-) nuclei at unphysically heavy pion massesusing different methods. For non-strange nuclear sys-tems, the current status of LQCD remains controver-sial, see [1740] for a review. On the EFT side, effortsconcentrated on extrapolating lattice QCD results asfollows:– Chiral extrapolations offew-nucleonobservableshavebeenstudiedusingavarietyofChEFTformulations,see e.g. Refs. [1741–1746]. Currently, the main lim-iting factor for constraining the quark mass depen-dence of the nuclear interactions is the lack of reli-able LQCD results for not-too-heavy quark masseswithin the applicability domain of ChEFT.
– Extrapolations of the NN scattering amplitude in en-ergy at fixed values of the quark masses were per-formed [1747, 1748] by exploiting the knowledge ofthe longest-range interaction due to the OPEP.
– Infinite-volume extrapolations of LQCD results forheavy pion masses were carried out in both pion-less[1749–1751] and chiral [1752] EFT.
– Finally, extrapolations of LQCD results to heaviersystems were considered in Ref. [1753] using theframework of pion-less EFT and in Ref. [1754] uti-lizing a discretized formulation of ChEFT.
These studies demonstrate remarkable synergy betweenLQCD and EFT. In the future, LQCD is expected toprovide valuable input for EFT calculations of systemsandprocesseswherescarceexperimentaldataexistsuchase.g.strangemulti-baryonsystemsandnuclearmatrixelements for BSM searches [1740].
6.3.5 Challenges and outlookTo summarize, ChEFT has revolutionized the field ofnuclear physics over the past three decades by pro-viding a systematically improvable and theoreticallywell founded approach to low-energy nuclear interac-tions, which relies on the symmetries of QCD (and theirbreaking pattern). The method has proven to be phe-nomenologically successful and has led to new researchdirections such as e.g. nuclear lattice simulations [1755–1757]. In the two-nucleon sector, ChEFT has alreadyreached maturity to become a precision tool.6.4 Soft collinear effective theory 223One of the most pressing remaining challenges is thedevelopment of accurate and precise three-nucleon in-teractions needed to shed light onto the long-standingdiscrepancies in the three-nucleon continuum [1725].
Pushing the ChEFT expansion for many-body forcesand exchange currents to N3LO and beyond calls for asymmetry preserving regularization [1702], and it willalso require new ideas to overcome computational chal-lenges related to the determination of LECs; see Refs.
[1758–1760] for recent steps along these lines. Otherfrontiers include the derivation of consistently regu-larized electroweak currents, better understanding ofrenormalization in ChEFT, precision studies of nuclearstructure, reactions and the equation of state of nu-clear matter as well as applications to searches for BSMphysics in processes involving nuclear systems.
6.4 Soft collinear effective theoryIain Stewart6.4.1 IntroductionEffective field theory is a powerful tool which enablesthe organization of QCD dynamics at different momen-tum scales. The most well known examples of EFTs in-volve the dynamics of massive particles, like integratingout the heavy electroweakW and Z bosons to obtainthe Electroweak Hamiltonian, or systematically treat-ing the mass scale of heavy quarks like thet, b, andcin HQET or NRQCD. On the other hand, much of ourknowledge about strong interactions comes from hardscatteringinteractionsoflightquarksandgluons,whichare the most important processes inpp, e−p, or e+e−colliders. Such processes are the way we search for newparticles or fundamental interactions at short distances,and indeed were key to the discovery of thec, b, andt quarks, the W and Z bosons, and the Higgs H. Inthese processes we must simultaneously deal with per-turbative QCD dynamics at the hard interaction scaleQ governing the dynamics of the high energy collision,as well as nonperturbative physics at the scaleΛ≪Q,which is responsible for the confinement and hadroniza-tion of partons. Many processes studied at colliders alsohave additional important intermediate scales∆, withΛ ≪∆ ≪Q. Examples of ∆ include the transversemomentum of particles inside an energetic jet producedfrom the collimated shower of a high energy quark orgluon, or the measurement of differential distributionsof a kinematic variable∆, where the largest cross sec-tion contributions typically arise from theΛ≪∆≪Qkinematic situation. The appropriate effective field the-ory for these processes is the Soft Collinear EffectiveTheory (SCET) [1761–1764]. Traditional QCD meth-ods, outside the framework of EFT, have a long tradi-tion for describing the physics of hard processes, includ-ing the Brodsky-Lepage/Efremov-Radyushkin formal-ism [206, 207, 1765] for exclusive hadronic processes,and the Collins-Soper-Sterman formalism [224, 1282,1347, 1766] for inclusive cross sections. SCET buildsnaturally on this foundation.
SCETisaneffectivetheorywhichsystematicallyde-scribes the infrared QCD dynamics in hard collisions,including the associated dynamics of soft and collineardegrees of freedom. Its popularity stems in part fromthe fact that it enables the description of a huge varietyof collider processes [1767]. This includes processes thatinvolve energetic hadrons such as largeQ2 form factorsγ∗γ → π0, γ∗π+ → π+, or fragmentation to one ormore hadronshi in processes likee+e−→ h1h2X andpp→h1X. Other examples include energetic hadroniccollisions like at the Large Hadron Collider, includ-ing Higgs production pp →HX and Drell-Yanpp →Xℓ+ℓ−, Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS)e−p→e−X ore−-ion →e−X, and Semi-Inclusive DISe−p →e−hX(for the latter see Ref. [1768]). SCET also describes pro-cesses that produce energetic jets instead of (or in addi-tion to) energetic hadrons, such ase+e− →2-jets [280,1769–1772], pp → H + 1 -jet [1773, 1774], or pp →2-jets [1775,1776].Inadditionitcanbeusedtodescribejet-substructure, the dynamics of particles and sub-jetsinside an identified jet [1777–1790]. Finally, it can alsobe used to describe the dynamics of heavy particle pro-duction and decay. Indeed some of the original applica-tions of SCET were to processes likeB →πℓν [1762,1791–1793], B → Dπ [1794, 1795], B → ππ [1792,1796], and B →Xsγ [1761, 1763, 1797–1801] (whereSCET is combined with HQET), as well ase+e− →J/ΨX [1802–1805] and Υ → Xγ [1505, 1506, 1806–1809] (where SCET is combined with NRQCD). Recentapplications of SCET include its extension to forwardscattering and Regge phenomena [1810–1813], heavy-ion collisions [1814–1819], gravitational effects [1820–1825], the resummation of large electroweak logarithms[1826–1832], large logs in dark matter annihilation crosssections[1833–1837],andradiativecorrectionsinneutrino-nucleon scattering [1838, 1839].
Features of SCET that people find useful include:the universal steps in derivingfactorization, wherebyobservables split themselves into independent functionsgoverning the hard, collinear and soft dynamics of aprocess, the transparency in carrying out higher orderresummation of large logarithms, the ability to gener-alize factorization to more complicated processes andmultiscale observables, and the capability to systemat-ically study power corrections.224 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESB Dπnμ -collinear modesnsoft modes soft modesultrasoft particles -collinear jetnμnμpa bn -collinear jetnFig. 6.4.1 Example processesB→ Dπ and e+e− → 2-jets.
6.4.2 Degrees of F reedomSCET describes collinear particles that are constituentsof energetic hadrons or jets and have a large momen-tum along a particular light-like directionnµi. For eachcollinear direction we have two reference vectorsnµi and¯nµi such thatn2i = ¯n2i = 0 and ni ·¯ni = 2 . A commonchoice is nµi = (1 ,ˆni) and ¯nµi = (1 ,−ˆni), with ˆni aunit three-vector in the collinear direction. Any four-momentum p can be decomposed in terms of these aspµ = ¯ni·pnµi2 + ni·p ¯nµi2 + pµni⊥ . (6.4.1)Particles with pµ close to nµi are referred to as ni-collinear and have (ni ·p,¯ni ·p,pni⊥) = ( p+,p−,p⊥)∼Q(λ2,1,λ), where λ ≪1 is the small SCET powercounting parameter, determined by scales and kinemat-icsorbymeasurementsrestrictingQCDradiation.SCETalso describes particles with soft momentapµ ∼Q(λ,λ,λ )and with ultrasoft (usoft)pµ ∼Q(λ2,λ2,λ2).
Examples are shown in Fig.6.4.1. In theB →Dπprocess, Q= {mb,mc,mb−mc}and λ= Λ/Q, with theB and D composed of a heavy quark, light soft quarks,and soft gluons. The pion hasEπ = 2.3 GeV = Q≫Λ,and has collinear quark and gluon constituents. In thee+e− →2-jets process, we have back-to-back jets withenergy Q, whereQ2 is the invariant mass of thee+e−pair, and λ = ∆/Q with Λ ≪∆ ≪Q. Here ∆ is ascale that characterizes the transverse size of the jet,and associated to measurements made on the jets. Forexample, if a hemisphere jet massmJ is measured, then∆= mJ, while if thrust1 −τ is measured,∆2 = Q2τ.
To ensure that collinear directions ni and nj aredistinct, we must haveni·nj ≫λ2 for i ̸= j. Sincedistinct reference vectors,ni and n′i, withni ·n′i ∼λ2both describe the same collinear physics, one can la-bel a collinear sector by any member of an equivalenceclass of vectors,{ni}. This freedom manifests as a sym-metry of the effective theory known as reparametriza-tion invariance (RPI) [1840, 1841]. Three classes of RPItransformations areRPI-I RPI-II RPI-IIIniµ →niµ+∆⊥µ niµ →niµ niµ →eαniµ¯niµ →¯niµ ¯niµ →¯niµ+ϵ⊥µ ¯niµ →e−α¯niµ,(6.4.2)whereα∼λ0 and infinitesimal parameters∆⊥ ∼λandϵ⊥ ∼λ0. These parameters satisfyni·∆⊥ = ¯ni·∆⊥ =ni ·ϵ⊥ = ¯ni ·ϵ⊥ = 0.
The effective theory is constructed by separatingcollinear momenta into large (label)˜pand small (resid-ual) pr componentspµ = ˜pµ + pµr = ¯ni·˜pnµi2 + ˜pµni⊥ + pµr , (6.4.3)with ¯ni ·˜p ∼ Q, ˜pni⊥ ∼ λQ. The small pµr ∼ λ2Qdescribes fluctuations about the label momentum. Tosimultaneously describe different regions of momentumspace with operators that have manifest power count-ing, it is necessary to have multiple fields for the samefundamental particle. Namely, for each collinear direc-tion we have collinear quark fieldsξni ∼λand collineargluon fieldsAµni ∼(λ2,λ0,λ), as well as soft quarkqs ∼λ3/2 and soft gluonAµs ∼λ fields, and/or usoft quarkqus ∼λ3 and usoft gluonAµus ∼λ2 fields. These powercounting assignments ensure that the corresponding ki-netic terms in the action areO(λ0).
The precise degrees of freedom depend on the pro-cess. Often only usoft or soft fields are present, in whichcase the theories are referred to asSCETI and SCETIIrespectively [1792].SCETI is relevant for measurementssensitive to the small ni ·p ∼Qλ2 momentum, suchas jet mass in e+e− → 2-jets, see Fig. 6.4.2; whileSCETII is relevant for measurements that involve trans-verse momenta or collinear and soft modes with thesame invariant mass. Examples also exist that requiremixedsoft-collinearmodeswith pµ ∼Q′(λ2,1,λ) whereQ′ ≪ Q, in which case the theory is referred to asSCET+; see Ref. [1787]. Independent collinear, soft,and usoft gauge symmetries are also enforced for eachset of fields [1764].

formula can be used to determine the order of any di-agram entirely from operators inserted at its verticesplus topological factors [1810, 1842].
To fully expand inλone must carry out a multipoleexpansion for the fields in SCET. There are two equiv-alent ways that this expansion has been constructed inthe literature, either in a combination with momentumspaceforlargelabelmomentaandpositionspacefortheresiduals, with fields written asξni,˜p(x) [1763], or withthe multipole expansion carried out entirely in positionspace [1791]. We will use the former, and facilitate theexpansion by defining two derivative operators, a la-bel momentum operator Pµni giving large momentumcomponents, such asPµni ξni,˜p = ˜pµξni,˜p, and a resid-ual momentum operator giving residual small compo-nents, such as i∂µξni,˜p(x) ∼Qλ2ξni,˜p(x). The short-hand ¯P= ¯ni ·Pni is used for the largestO(λ0) labelmomentum. Useful covariant derivatives includei¯n·Dn = ¯P+ g¯n·An, iDµn⊥ = Pµ⊥ + gAµn⊥in·Dn = in·∂+ gn·An, iDµus = i∂µ + gAµusin·D = in·∂+ gn·Aus + gn·An , (6.4.4)where Aµn ≡AAµn TA and igFAµνn TA = [ iDµn,iDνn] =igFµνn .Thisisthestandardsignconventionfor gusedinthe SCET literature. It differs from the QCD summaryabove (g→−g).
6.4.3 SCET Lagrangian and F actorizationThe SCET Lagrangian isLSCET = Lhard+Ldyn =∑i≥0(L(i)hard+L(i)dyn)+L(0)G ,(6.4.5)where the superscript(i) indicates terms suppressed byO(λi) relative to the leading power Lagrangian. Herethehardshortdistanceinteractionsareencodedin L(i)hardwith only one of these appearing in each amplitude (un-less we study multiple hard scatterings). They containmultiple types of collinear (and soft) fields. The dy-namic LagrangiansL(i)dyn describe the evolution and in-teractions of collinear and (u)soft particles. We havesingled out the so-called Glauber LagrangianL(0)G forspecial treatment since it is the only term that violatesfactorization of collinear and (u)soft modes [1810].
At leading power the dynamicSCETI and SCETIILagrangians are [1764]LI(0)dyn =∑nL(0)n + L(0)us ,LII(0)dyn =∑nL(0)n + L(0)s , (6.4.6)where the first terms sum over all needed independentcollinear sectors. InSCETII each ofL(0)n and L(0)s onlyinvolves collinear or soft fields, so the sectors are imme-diately factorized by the power expansion. InSCETIthe n·Aus fields still interact with collinear fields sincethey are O(λ2) just like n·∂ and n·An, and do notknock the collinear particles offshell (meaning that ini-tial and final particles have momenta satisfying thecollinear power counting). These n·Aus interactionscan be decoupled by the BPS field redefinition [1764]ξn(x) →Yn(x)ξn(x), Aµn(x) →Yn(x)Aµn(x)Y†n(x),(6.4.7)where Yn is an ultrasoft Wilson lineYn(x; −∞,0) = Pexp(ig∫ 0−∞dsn·Aus(x+ ns)),(6.4.8)and P is path ordering of color matrices withs. Thistransformation moves usoft interactions into the hardscattering operators, and leaves factorized LagrangiansL(0)n and L(0)us, which only depend on collinear or usoftfields respectively. For example, for collinear quarks inSCETI we haveLI(0)nξ = e−ix·P ¯ξn(in·D + i/Dn⊥1i¯n·Dni/Dn⊥)/¯n2 ξn→e−ix·P ¯ξn(in·Dn + i/Dn⊥1i¯n·Dni/Dn⊥)/¯n2 ξn.
(6.4.9)The first few Feynman rules prior to the field redef-inition are shown in Fig. 6.4.3, and the one in thesecond line is removed fromLI(0)nξ after implementingEq.(6.4.7).Afterthetransformationthe L(0)n Lagrangianhas the same form inSCETI and SCETII.226 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESp = in /2¯n· pn· p¯n· p + p2⊥ + i0 μ , A= igT Anµ¯n /2p pɂμ , A = igTA[nµ+ γ⊥µp /⊥¯n· p + p′/⊥γ⊥µ¯n· p′ − p′/⊥p /⊥¯nµ¯n· p¯n· p′] ¯n /2Fig. 6.4.3O(λ0) Feynman rules for collinear quarks (dashed)interacting with a soft gluon (spring) or collinear gluon (springwith a line through it). Rules with more collinear gluons arenot shown.
TheconstructionofSCEThardscatteringLagrangiansL(i)hard requires integrating out offshell fields, which havelarger p2 than the collinear and (u)soft fields (see Fig.
6.4.2 for example). When collinear particles in two dif-ferent sectors interact, the resulting particles are hardand offshell with p2 ∼ Q2. Likewise when collinearand soft particles interact this results in offshell hard-collinear particles with p2 ∼Q2λ. Systematically in-tegrating out the corresponding offshell fields resultsin collinear and soft Wilson lines appearing in opera-tors [1762–1764]. This involves an infinite number ofgluon attachments and can be carried out analyticallywith background field techniques [1764, 1767]. In labelmomentum space the resulting collinear Wilson linesare defined asWni(x) =[ ∑permsexp(−g¯P¯n·Ani(x))]. (6.4.10)Note that it is the¯ni·An ∼λ0 component of the gluonfield that appears in these Wilson lines. In general allO(λ0) gluon components can be traded for Wilson linesusing i¯ni·Dni = Wni¯PW†ni. UnlikeYn, the subscript onWni refers to the collinear fields it is built out of, notthe Wilson line direction (which is¯ni). For zero residualmomentum x = (0 ,x−,x⊥), the Wn(x) is simply theFourier transform (b+ ↔p−) of a standard position-space Wilson line ending atb= (b+,x−,x⊥):Wn(b; −∞,0) = P exp(ig∫ 0−∞ds¯n·An(b+ ¯ns)).
(6.4.11)Since the construction of hard-collinear interactions inSCETII can be facilitated by matching QCD→SCETI→SCETII [1792],itsufficestoprimarilyfocusonmatch-ing for SCETI. The definition for the soft Wilson lineSn(x; −∞,0) appearing in SCETII is identical to Eq.
(6.4.8) withAus →As.

Hard interactions involving collinear fermions pro-vide a frame of reference that allows us to simplifythe Dirac structures that appear, since so-called goodfermion components dominate over bad components inthe λ expansion. In SCET this is encoded by the pro-jection relations(n /i¯n /i/4)ξni = ξni, which also impliesn /iξni = 0. The same formulae also hold forχni. Only thegood components are needed to construct operators inSCET at any order in the power expansion, and indeedwe have already writtenL(0)nξ in Eq.(6.4.9) using them.
Note that on its own, Eq.(6.4.9) is equivalent to a QCDLagrangian for collinear quarks (indeed it has the sameform as the light-cone QCD Lagrangian [1843]), witha distinction made only by which fermion componentsare sourced in the path integral.
Integrating out offshell fluctations also results inWilson coefficients that depend on the largeO(λ0) mo-mentaof collinear fields.It is straightforwardtosee whythis is the case, since if we annihilate or produce twocollinear particles withpµn = ω1nµ/2 and pµ¯n = ω2¯nµ/2,then q = pn + p¯n has q2 = ω1ω2 ∼Q2. Thus offshellfluctuations that depend on Q2 also depend on thelarge momenta ωi ∼λ0 of collinear fields. Two otherconstraints on the form of hard operators are SCETgauge invariance and the ability to use the equationsof motion to reduce the operators basis to a minimalset. This is summarized by the fact that all operatorscan be constructed out of a minimal set of buildingblocks, formed from combinations of fields and Wilsonlines [1762, 1763, 1844]. The collinearly gauge-invariantquark and gluon building block fields are defined asχni,ω(x) =[δ(ω−¯Pni) W†ni(x) ξni(x)], (6.4.12)Bµni⊥,ω(x) = 1g[δ(ω+ ¯Pni) W†ni(x) iDµni⊥Wni(x)].
The Wilson linesWni(x) are localized with respect tothe positionx, and we can therefore treatχni,ω(x) andBµni,ω(x) as local quark and gluon fields from the per-spective of ultrasoft derivatives∂µ that act onx. Ourconventions forχni,ω haveω >0 for an incoming quarkand ω <0 for an outgoing antiquark at lowest order.
For Bni⊥,ω, ω > 0 (ω < 0) corresponds to outgoing(incoming) gluons at lowest order.
For SCETI the complete set of building blocks andtheirpowercountingissummarizedinTable 6.4.1.Boththe χn and Bn⊥ building block fields scale asO(λ). For6.4 Soft collinear effective theory 227the majority of jet processes there is a single collinearfield operator for each collinear sector at leading power.
For exclusive processes that directly produce energetichadrons at the hard interaction (rather than by frag-mentation) there are multiple building blocks from thesame sector in the leading power operators, since wemust form a color singlet in each sector in order to di-rectly produce a color singlet hadron. TheP⊥ ∼λ isnot typically present at leading power. At subleadingpower, operators for all processes can involve multiplecollinear fields in the same collinear sector, as well asP⊥ operator insertions. The power counting for an op-erator is obtained by simply adding up the powers forthe building blocks it contains. To ensure consistencyunder renormalization group evolution the operator ba-sis in SCET must be complete, namely all operatorsconsistent with the symmetries of the problem mustbe included. The counting of subleading power opera-tors is greatly facilitated by spinor-helicity SCET tech-niques [1845–1849].
A few examples of hard scattering operators canhelp clarify the above points. ForSCETI processes likethrust, jet mass, or other dijet event shapes ine+e−collisions, or for threshold resummation in Drell-Yan orDIS, the leading power Lagrangian from the electro-magnetic current isLI(0)hard(0) = ie2Q2 Jµ¯ℓℓ∫dω1dω2 C(0)f (ω1ω2,µ)×[(¯χf¯n,ω2 ) (Y†¯nYn)γ⊥µ(χfn,ω1 )]µ, (6.4.13)where C(0)f is the Wilson coefficient encoding virtualhard interactions at any order inαs, and renormaliza-tion is carried out in theMS scheme, inducing depen-dence on the renormalization scale µ. In Eq.(6.4.13)the usoft Wilson linesY†¯nYn appear from the BPS fieldredefinition in Eq.(6.4.7). Also, the leptonic vector cur-rent isJµ¯ℓℓ = ( −1)¯ℓγµℓ, and we sum over quark flavorsf. At any order inαs the Wilson coefficientC(0)f (ω1ω2)encodes virtual corrections from the hard scaleω1ω2 ∼Q2. For hard Lagrangians with only a single field in agiven collinear direction, the large collinear momentumfactorsωi are fixed by the overall kinematics of the hardprocess, and thus remain unchanged by perturbativecorrections. For example,ω1 = ω2 = Q for e+e− →2-jets. At tree levelC(0)f = Qf+O(αs), where the quarkshave charge Qf|e|. To calculateC(0)f at higher orderswe carry out loop level matching calculations, compar-ing hard scattering Feynman diagrams separately com-puted and renormalized in full QCD and in SCETI,while using the same states and infrared (IR) regula-tors. Since SCET captures all the IR physics, the dif-ference between these calculations determinesC(0)f or-der by order, and implies it encodes hard effects. Forthe particular example in Eq.(6.4.13), C(0)f is related tothe IR finite part of theMS massless quark form fac-tor withQ2 ≫Λ2. (In general when carrying out loopcalculations in SCET with both (u)soft and collinearloops, one must include 0-bin subtractions which en-sure there is not double counting of IR regions [1850].
For some choices of IR regulators these subtractions arescaleless in dimensional regularization, and hence canbe dropped, up to interpreting the divergence struc-ture.)ForSCETII processeslikethebroadeningeventshapefor e+e− →2-jets, or transverse momentum dependent(TMD) distributions for Drell-Yan, SIDIS, ore+e− →h1h2X, the leading hard scattering Lagrangian isLII(0)hard(0) = ie2Q2 Jµ¯ℓℓ∫dω1dω2 C(0)f (ω1ω2,µ)×[(¯χf¯n,ω2 ) (S†¯nSn)γ⊥µ(χfn,ω1 )]µ, (6.4.14)with the same Wilson coefficient C(0)f as Eq.(6.4.13).
The only difference is the appearance of soft Wilsonlines S instead of usoft Y. This operator can be ob-tainedimmediatelyfromEq.( 6.4.13)bymatching SCETI→SCETII.
As a final example we consider¯B0 →D+π− medi-ated by the weakW-boson flavor changing transitionb →c¯ud. Here the matching is from the electroweakHamiltonian HW = 2√2GFV∗udVcb∑i=0,8 CFi Oi, with4-quark operators O0 = [¯cγµPLb][ ¯dγµPLu] and O8 =[¯cγµTAPLb][ ¯dγµPLTAu], onto coefficients and opera-tors in SCET. The heavy quark fields are matched ontoHQET fields h(Q)v for Q = b,c, while the light quarksbecome collinear. The leading power hard scatteringLagrangian in SCET is [1794]LII(0)hard =∫dω1dω2 Cj(0)BDπ(ω1,ω2,mb,mc,µ)×{[¯h(c)v′ Γjhh(b)v][(¯χ¯dn,ω2 ) Γξ(χun,ω1 )]}µ, (6.4.15)where we sum overj = 1,5 with Dirac structuresΓ1,5h =n /{1,γ5}/2 and Γξ = ¯n /(1 −γ5)/4. Here the hard co-efficients Cj(0)BDπ depend on multiple hard scales as inEq.(6.4.15). There are no soft Wilson lines because then-collinear quark pair is a color singlet andS†nSn =1. An analogous SCET operator with color structureTA⊗TA exists and does involve soft Wilson lines. Sinceit can be factorized into a product of soft and collinearoctet operators, it does not contribute to the physicalprocess: a factorized octet collinear bilinear operatorcan not produce a color singlet pion.
Let us return to the leading power Glauber La-grangian.Itinvolvesinteractionsbetweensoftandcollinear228 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESmodes in the form of potentials, and has the form [1810]L(0)G =∑n,¯nOiBn1P2⊥OBCs1P2⊥OjC¯n +∑nOiBn1P2⊥OjnBs ,(6.4.16)inboth SCETI andSCETII.Furtherdetailsandthedef-initions for the operatorsOcan be found in Ref. [1810].
Many of the steps involved in deriving factorization atleadingpoweraremanifestintheconstructionofSCET;in particular we arrive at hard scattering LagrangiansL(0)hard that can be written as products of gauge invariantcollinear and soft operators, and we have a direct sumof independent Lagrangians for soft and collinear fieldsin L(0)dyn. With just these terms the SCET Hilbert spaceof states factorizes as direct products, and matrix ele-ments of collinear and soft operators with their Wilsoncoefficients define independent collinear, soft and hardfunctions (examples given below). SinceL(0)G can be in-serted any number of times without power suppression,and couples different sectors, it breaks factorization.
Thus proving factorization reduces to demonstrat-ing that contributions fromL(0)G either cancel out, orcan be absorbed into other interactions. Both of theseoccur. For example, ine+e− →2-jets the non-trivialinteractions fromL(0)G can be absorbed into thedirec-tion of the (u)soft and collinear Wilson lines, which inthat case then run from[0,∞) rather than(−∞,0], seeRef. [1810]. The same absorption is true for the exclu-sive B →Dπ process, with the common feature beingthat these processes involve only active partons and donot involve forward scattering configurations (see alsoRefs. [1851, 1852]). In a process like Drell-Yan the can-cellation of L(0)G is much more complicated due to in-teractions involving spectator partons in the initial pro-tons, but these still cancel out. Low order demonstra-tions can be found in Refs. [1810, 1853, 1854], while theall order statement was made in the classic CSS proofof Glauber region cancellations in Ref. [1766]. For caseswhere factorization is known to be violated [1852,1855–1859], it is not possible to absorb or cancel the effects ofL(0)G inthismanner.ThefactorizationofGlaubereffectsin SCET can also be used to sum so-called superleadinglogarithms [1860].
It is worth noting that in SCET the proof of fac-torization for cross sections and decay rates at sublead-ing power follows the same steps as at leading power.
Higher power L(i≥1)hard simply involve more complicatedproductsoffactorizedsoftandcollinearoperators.Whiletermsin L(i≥1)dyn alsoinvolveproductsofsoftandcollinearfields, they are always inserted only a finite number oftimes at any given order in the power counting, andhence still lead to factorized matrix elements, albeitwith time ordered products of operators. For a gaugeinvariant description of power suppressedSCETI oper-ators see Refs. [1861, 1862]. Many of these observationsgo back to the beginnings of SCET, since the processesthat people focused on at the time involved exclusiveBdecays that only start at subleading power [1791–1793,1795–1797,1863–1867], primarily because the soft spec-tatorquarkinthe Bhadtobeconvertedintoacollinearquark, a subleading power process.
Finally, we remark thatL(0)G is interesting in its ownright, because for processes involving forward scatter-ing rather than hard scattering, it does not cancel butinstead provides the dominant contributions, yieldingReggeization, BFKL evolution, and the shockwave pic-ture. For more work in this direction see Refs. [1810–1813]. It is also worth noting that this implies thatSCET can potentially provide a framework to param-eterize and describe spectator factorization violatingcontributions to certain hard scattering processes fromfirst principles, though so far very little work has beendone in this direction.
6.4.4 Examples of F actorizationTo connect theory and experiment, consider a few ex-amples of factorization formulae that have been derivedor studied with SCET. A key attribute of these formu-las is that they are determined using only the SCETpower expansion, and do not rely on anyαs expansion.
First consider e+e− →2-jets, with a measurement ofτ = 1 −T where T is thrust, working in the dijet limitτ ≪1. We can relateτ to the sum of the two hemi-sphere jet masses, τ = ( m2Ja + m2Jb)/Q2, where m2Jaand m2Jb are each determined by the particles on oneside of the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis. Thusτ ≪1 restricts the invariant mass of the radiation inboth hemispheres and forces us into a dijet configu-ration. Squaring theSCETI leading power amplitudesobtained from L(0)hard in Eq.(6.4.13), Fierzing the fieldsof distinct types into independent matrix elements, in-tegrating over phase space with the measurement func-tion, and renormalizing the resulting factorized func-tions, gives [280, 1769–1772]dσdτ = σ0H(Q,µ)Q∫dℓdℓ′JT(Q2τ −Qℓ,µ)×ST(ℓ−ℓ′,µ)F(ℓ′,Λ) . (6.4.17)Here H(Q,µ) = |C(0)(Q,µ)|2 is a hard function en-coding virtual corrections (magenta line in Fig.6.4.2),the thrust jet functionJT = J ⊗J combines two jetfunctions J obtained from then-collinear or¯n-collinearmatrix elements (dots on the blue line in Fig.6.4.2),and the full soft function is defined from a vacuum6.4 Soft collinear effective theory 229matrix element of usoft Wilson lines. This soft func-tion can be further factorized into two parts,ST ⊗F,where ST is perturbative (green line in Fig.6.4.2) andF is nonperturbative (brown line in Fig.6.4.2) [1800,1868]. Renormalization group evolution ofHT, JT, andST enables a summation of large Sudakov double loga-rithms, αsln2 τ. The state-of-the-art for this resumma-tion is next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic or-der (N3LL), and was first achieved with SCET [1772].
For Λ ≪Qτ ≪Q the nonperturbative effects fromFare power corrections, so the spectrum is dominated byperturbation theory, and is used to obtain high preci-sion fits forαs(MZ) [280, 281, 1869].
DIS, e−p →e−X, provides another useful SCETfactorization example [1767]. It is simplest to considerin the Breit frame where the virtual photon hasqµ =(0,0,0,Q). Here the factorization theorem is betweenhard and collinear modes withλ= Λ/Q, and soft con-tributions cancel out. A feature of this process is thatthe hard contributions come from both virtual effectsas well as real radiation inX. Therefore matching ontoWilson coefficients Ci(0)jDIS(ωi,Q,µ ) takes place at thelevel of the amplitude squared, and so does the con-struction of the appropriate SCET operators. Theseoperators involve collinear quarks in¯χqn,ω1 ¯n /χqn,ω2 withflavorq, or collinear gluons inBνn⊥,ω1 Bn⊥,ω2ν. The pro-ton matrix elements ⟨p|···| p⟩of these operators de-fine the well known quark parton distribution functions(PDFs) fq/p(ξ,µ) and gluon PDFs fg/p(ξ,µ), respec-tively. Carrying out the same steps listed above to ar-rive at Eq.(6.4.17) now gives factorization theorems forDIS structure functions. For exampleW1(x,Q2) = −1x∫ 1xdξ H(i)1 (ξ/x,Q,µ ) fi/p(ξ,µ2) ,(6.4.18)where we sum over parton typesi, and the hard func-tion H(i)1 = (1 /π) Im Ci(0)1DIS. There is a similar formulafor W2(x,Q2). Eq.(6.4.18) factorizes perturbative shortdistance contributions inH(i)1 at the scaleQ from thenonperturbative PDFs fi/p at the scale Λ. Here therenormalization group evolution (RGE) sums up singlelogs αsln(Q/µ0), for a hadronic scaleµ0 ≃1 GeV >Λ.
ThusSCETreproducesclassicDISresultsinaverysim-ple manner. For example, the fact that¯χqn,ω1 ¯n /χqn,ω2 ∼λ2 is related to the PDFs being built from twist-2 oper-ators.The operator withWilson lines inSCET capturesthe full tower of twist-2 operators simultaneously.
Toprovidea SCETII example,weconsidertheHiggstransverse momentumqT in pp→H+ X in the regionwhere Q = mH ≫qT ≫Λ. Due to the measurementof qT ∼ Qλ there is a restriction on the final stateX. It can involve collinear and soft particles which in-dividually have pT ∼ Qλ, but can no longer involvehard particles. Due to this restriction, the hard match-ing takes place at the amplitude level in this case, giv-ing L(0)hard ∝C(0)H (ωi,µ)tr[Bνn⊥,ω1 STnS¯nB¯n⊥,ω2ν]µ, whereS are soft Wilson lines in the adjoint representation.
Since this only involves one field of each collinear type,theωi momentaarefixedby QandtheHiggsrapidity Yto beω1 = QeY and ω2 = Qe−Y. Here the factorizationis simplest in Fourier spacedσdQdYd2⃗ pHT= 2HggH(Q,µ)∫d2⃗bT ei⃗bT·⃗ pHT SH(bT,µ,ν )×Bαβg/p(xa,⃗bT,µ,ζ a/ν2)Bg/pαβ(xb,⃗bT,µ,ζ b/ν2)= HggH(Q,µ)∫d2⃗bT ei⃗bT·⃗ pHT×[f1g/p(xa,bT,µ,ζ a)f1g/p(xb,bT,µ,ζ b)+ h⊥1g/p(xa,bT,µ,ζ a)h⊥1g/p(xb,bT,µ,ζ b)], (6.4.19)where xa = QeY/√s, xb = Qe−Y/√s, sis the invariantmass of the colliding protons, andζa,b are Collins-Soperparameters satisfying ζaζb = Q4. Here the hard func-tion is HggH ∝|C(0)H |2 (leaving out simple kinematicprefactors), the squared⟨p|···| p⟩matrix element ofn-collinear fields yields the beam functionBαβg/p (and like-wise for ¯n), and the squared vacuum matrix elementof soft Wilson lines yields the soft functionSH. In thefinal line of Eq.(6.4.19) we did two things in one step:i) grouped a√SH together with each beam function toabsorb the soft function symmetrically, and ii) decom-posed the Lorentz indicesαβ into two possible struc-tures, gαβT f1g/p and (bαTbβT +⃗b2TgαβT /2)h⊥1g/p. This yieldsdefinitions for the TMD PDFsf1g/p (unpolarized gluonTMD PDF) andh⊥1g/p (linearly polarized gluon TMDPDF).
A novel feature of this factorization theorem is theappearance of the rapidity scaleν in the collinear andsoft functions, which is associated to the need to regu-laterapiditydivergencesinmany SCETII processes[ 1850,1870–1873], and the presence of the associated rapidityrenormalization group equations [1872, 1874]. The re-sult in the first line of Eq.(6.4.19) is presented with therapidity regulator defined in [1872] and may look some-what different with other choices of the rapidity regula-tor, such as in the original Collins construction [1269].
However the result in the final line will be the same.
Evolution in bothµ and ν is needed to sum the largelogs, αsln2(Q/qT), in this process, and the state of theart is resummation at N3LL. This resummation mayalso be done at the level of the TMD PDFs, where therapidity RGE is replaced by the Collins-Soper evolutionin ζa,b [1347].230 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESAs our final example, we consider the measurementof jet mass in inclusive jet production, pp →jet+X,where the jet has radius R and is defined with theanti-kT algorithm. To make this example more inter-esting (and more phenomenologically relevant) we alsocarry out jet grooming to remove soft contaminating ra-diation in the jet, using the soft drop algorithm [1875,1876]. Examples of contaminating radiation in the jetinclude initial state radiation from the protons, under-lying event effects due to radiation from spectator par-tons, and pileup effects due to radiation from the inter-action among other protons in the colliding beams. Thesoft-drop grooming is defined by iteratively applying atest on transverse momentumpT and angular separa-tions ∆Rof branchesiand j in an angular ordered treeformed from particles in the jet: min(pTi,pTj)/(pTi +pTj) > zcut(∆Rij/R0)β where zcut, β, andR0 are softdrop parameters. Branches that fail this test are re-moved from the tree, thus grooming soft radiation. Thiscauses the soft function for this process to split itselfinto two parts [1786]: a global soft function sensitive tothe scaleQzcut associated with the groomed soft radi-ation, and a collinear-soft function,Sκc, that describessoftradiationthatiscollimatedenoughwiththejetaxisto have been retained by the grooming. The groomedjet mass cross section can be factorized as [1786, 1877,1878]dσdm2JdΦJ= Nκ(ΦJ,R,z cut,β,µ )Q11+βcut∫dℓ×Jκ(m2J −Qℓ,µ)Sκc[ℓQ11+βcut ,β,µ],(6.4.20)with a sum onκ = q,g for quark and gluon jets andQcut = pTRzcut(R/R0)β. HereJκ is the usual jet func-tion since the collinear radiation is not affected by thegrooming. The normalization factorNκ is a short handfor a combination of terms that include PDFs, a hard-collinear function describing the production of the par-ton κ, and the global soft function. This is an exampleof aSCET+ factorization formula due to the presenceof soft-collinear modes that make up the Wilson linesthat appear inSκc. Groomed observables have becomewidely used in predictions at hadron colliders due to thefact that they are much more robust to contamination,and have reduced hadronization corrections. Other ex-amples of soft drop groomed calculations with SCETare found in Refs. [1788, 1790, 1878–1893].
6.4.5 State-of-the-Art and Attractive DirectionsThe nature of a short review is that key ideas can behighlighted, but it is hard to do credit to the depth ofwork in the field. Let me close by giving a brief overviewof some of the interesting centers of activity currentlygoing on with SCET, with an eye to the future.
SCET continues to have a significant impact on thefield of high precision calculations for collider cross sec-tions, in particular for the resummation of large log-arithms. This activity is motivated by the clear uni-versality of anomalous dimensions and factorized func-tions in SCET, giving results of broad utility. Below Isummarize the highest order results achieved to datefor various processes which exploit these perturbativeachievements, referring to references therein for furtherbackground and details. This list includes:e+e− thrustto N3LL′ [280,1772]and massivethrust to N3LL[1894],e+e− heavyjetmasstoN 3LL[1895],e+e− C-parametertoN3LL′ [1896],e+e− Energy-Energy-Correlator(EEC)to N3LL′ [1897], e+e− oriented event shapes to N3LL[1898], e+e− groomed jet mass to N3LL [1899], e+e− →t¯tthrusttoN 3LL[1900],e−pDISthrusttoN 3LL[1901–1904],theDrell-Yan pℓℓT spectrumtoN 3LL′ [1905,1906],the pp Higgs pHT spectrum [1907–1909] and rapidityspectrum [1910] to N3LL′, and LHC processes with ajet-veto [1773, 1911–1916]. Recently the first N4LL re-summed calculation has been carried out for the EEC[1917](withanapproximationforthe5-loopcuspanoma-lous dimension). Key ingredients are the four-loop hard(collinear) anomalous dimensions [1918,1919], the four-loop rapidity anomalous dimension for TMDs [1917,1920], the four-loop cusp anomalous dimension [1921]and five-loop approximation [1922], and calculationsof three loop boundary conditions [1923–1926]. ManymoreprocesseshavebeenresummedtoNNLLorNNLL ′order with SCET; for example in Refs. [1474, 1774,1775, 1778, 1878, 1891, 1923, 1927–1959]. Factorizedfunctions remain important targets for future pertur-bative calculations, with the anticipated reward of si-multaneously impacting multiple processes.
Power corrections are another lively topic in SCET,from the continued activity aroundB-decays, to recentsignificant results for collider physics. A key strength ofSCET is its systematic nature, ensuring one can targetthedesiredtermswithoutmissingcontributions.Recentcollider physics literature on subleading power resultsin SCET includes: formalism such as enumerating op-erator bases [1846–1848, 1960, 1961], hard renormaliza-tion and evolution [1960, 1962–1964], collinear and softrenormalization and evolution [1965–1968], subleadingpower factorization [1768, 1969–1973], and resumma-tion for collider observables, including for event shapes[1965, 1974, 1975], for threshold resummation [1976–1978], and for the EEC [1979]. These results providebright prospects for the future, with the ultimate goalof building a complete story for the structure of gauge6.5 Hard thermal loop effective theory 231theories like QCD beyond leading power, and thus gen-eralizingtheleadingpowerpictureofcollinearsplittingsand soft eikonal radiation.
One popular method for carrying out fixed ordercalculations at higher orders, is that of slicing, wherebya resolution variable is used to act as a physical reg-ulator for infrared divergences, enabling analytic andnumerical calculations to be combined in a systematicway. SCET has contributed to this program with theinvention of N-jettiness subtractions [1980, 1981] basedon the N-jettiness event shape variable [1776]. It hasalso been used to calculate power suppressed large log-arithms, enabling order-of-magnitude improvements toslicing techniques [1849, 1966, 1982–1989]. Further im-provements to such techniques will be important as the-orists continue to move towards calculating experimen-tally accessible fiducial cross sections.
Other interesting applications of SCET include: thegeneralization of threshold factorization formulae to in-clude collinear limits [1990, 1991], the computation ofnon-globallogarithmsandassociatedeffects[ 1784,1992–2005], the parametrization of hadronization correctionswith field theory matrix elements [2006–2008], study-ing fragmentation inside a jet [1881, 1885, 1957, 2009–2021], and to studying double parton distributions andfragmentation [2022–2025]. A particularly interestingdirection with many connections to other fields is thestudyofEECs.ResultsfromSCETincludederivingfac-torizationfortheback-to-backlimit[ 2026],andcollinearlimit[2027,2028],jetanalyseswithchargedtracks[ 2029],generalizing factorization to the back-to-back limit athadron colliders [2030], and deriving factorization for-mulaforjetsubstructureapplicationsoftheEEC[ 2031].
The prospects for new applications of SCET technologyremain bright.
A final hallmark of SCET is the use of the physicalpicture it provides to construct novel observables. Pastexamples of this type include: beam thrust and func-tions[1804,2032,2033],N-jettiness[ 1776],N-subjettiness[2034], jet substructure for disentangling color and spinin J/Ψ production [2014, 2035], D2 and related jet-substructure observables [1781,2036–2038], the winner-takes-all-axis for jets [1889, 2039–2041], track functions[2042–2045], the XCone jet algorithm [2046], collineardrop [1887, 2047], an EEC probe of top mass [2048],and measuring initial state tomography with a NuclearEEC [2049]. I look forward to many more examples ofsuch new observables in the future.
6.5 Hard thermal loop effective theoryMichael StricklandIn this section we review progress in understandingQCD at finite temperature and density. Unlike QCDin vacuum new classes of physical infrared divergencesappear which cause naive perturbation theory to breakdown. Luckily, at least at leading order in the couplingconstant, it is possible to identify a class of diagramsthat must be resummed in order to cure these diver-gences.
6.5.1 The breakdown of naive perturbation the-ory at finite temperatureThere are two fundamental formalisms for computingthe properties of QCD at high temperature: (1) thereal-time formalism and (2) the imaginary-time formal-ism [2050–2052]. The former is necessary when consid-ering systems that are out of equilibrium, while the sec-ond is more convenient for computing bulk thermody-namic quantities. Here we will focus on the imaginary-time formalism and progress that has been made inunderstanding how to reorganize the perturbative ex-pansion of finite temperature QCD in order to dealwith infrared singularities which emerge in this caseusing self-consistent inclusion of Debye screening andLandau damping. This is accomplished through an all-orders resummation of a class of diagrams referred toas the hard-thermal-loop (HTL) diagrams. For an in-troduction to the real-time formalism and applicationsto real-world calculations we refer the reader to Sec.6.6and Ref. [2051].
In thermal and chemical equilibrium with temper-ature T and quark chemical potentialsµi with πT ≫µi, one finds that the naive loop expansion of physi-cal quantities is ill-defined and diverges beyond a givenloop order, which depends on the quantity under con-sideration. In the calculation of QCD thermodynamics,this stems from uncanceled infrared (IR) divergencesthat enter the expansion of the partition function atthree-loop order. These IR divergences are due to long-distanceinteractionsmediatedbystaticgluonfieldsandresult in contributions that are non-analytic inαs =g2/4π, e.g.,α3/2s and log(αs), unlike vacuum perturba-tion expansions which involve only powers ofαs.
A simple way to understand at which perturbativeorders terms non-analytic inαs appear is to start fromthe contribution of non-interacting static gluons to agiven quantity. For the pressure of a gas of gluons onehas Pgluons ∼∫d3ppn B(Ep), wherenB denotes a Bose-Einstein distribution function andEp is the energy of232 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESthe in-medium gluons. The contributions from the mo-mentum scalesπT, gT and g2T can be expressed asPp∼πTgluons ∼T4nB(πT) ∼ T4 + O(g2) , (6.5.1)Pp∼gTgluons ∼(gT)4nB(gT) ∼ g3T4 + O(g4) , (6.5.2)Pp∼g2Tgluons ∼(g2T)4nB(g2T) ∼ g6T4 , (6.5.3)where we have using the fact that nB(E) ∼ T/E ifE ≪T. This fact is of fundamental importance since itimplies that when the energy/momentum aresoft, cor-responding to electrostatic contributions, psoft ∼gT,one receives an enhancement of1/g compared to con-tributions from hard momenta, phard ∼T, due to thebosonic nature of the gluon. For ultrasoft (magneto-static) momenta,pultrasoft ∼g2T, the contributions areenhanced by1/g2 compared to the naive perturbativeorder. As the Eqs. (6.5.1)-(6.5.3) demonstrate, it is pos-sible to generate contributions of the orderg3 ∼α3/2sfrom soft momenta and, in the case of the pressure,although perturbatively enhanced, ultrasoft momentaonly start to play a role at orderg6 ∼α3s.
Note that the expansion parameters in Eqs. (6.5.1)to (6.5.3) are of orderg2nB(πT) ∼g2, g2nB(gT) ∼g,and g2nB(g2T) ∼ 1, implying in particular that thecontribution of magnetostatic gluons to the pressureis fundamentally non-perturbative in nature atO(α3s),which for the pressure corresponds to four-loop order.
This complete breakdown of the loop expansion at theultrasoft scale is called theLinde problem [2053, 2054].
The specific order at which the expansion breaks downdepends on the quantity under consideration and isnot universal. For example, in Ref. [2055], the authorsdemonstrated that a certain second-order transport co-efficient, λ1, receives a leading-order contribution fromthe ultrasoft scale. We also note that, in the case of theO(α3s) contribution to the pressure it is possible to iso-late the purely non-perturbative contribution and com-pute this numerically using a three-dimensional latticecalculation [2056]. Paradoxically, the difficult part thenbecomes computing the perturbative contributions atthis order [2057]. Beyond four-loop order, all contribu-tions are once again perturbatively computable.
As a result of the infrared enhancement of electro-static contributions it was shown that a class of di-agrams called hard-thermal-loop (HTL) graphs whichhave soft external and hard internal momenta need tobe resummed to all orders in the strong coupling cou-pling [2058–2060]. In the high temperature limit, thereexist several schemes for carrying out such resumma-tions, see e.g. [2061–2079]. Here we will briefly reviewthe method of dimensionally reduced effective theories(EFTs), which take advantage of the scale hierarchiesand the manifestly gauge-invariant hard thermal loopperturbationtheory(HTLpt)resummation.Thismakesuse of the HTL effective action to reorganize the per-turbative expansion of finite temperature and densityQCD [2080].
6.5.2 Dimensional reduction and QCD EFTThe method of dimensional reduction is based on thefactthat,atweak-coupling,thereisahierarchyofscalesbetween the three energy scales (hard, soft, and ultra-softor,equivalently,hard,electric,andmagnetic)whichcontribute to bulk thermodynamic observables. Specif-ically, ifg≪1, one hasmmagnetic ∼g2T ≪melectric ∼gT ≪mhard ∼πT.
(6.5.4)Above we have denoted the magnetostatic and electro-static screening scales by mmagnetic and melectric, re-spectively, and the hard or thermal one, correspondingto the lowest non-zero Matsubara frequency, bymhard.
To leading order, the electrostatic screening mass canbe computed from the IR limit of theA0 one-loop selfenergy, however, the magnetic screening mass cannotbe computed perturbatively [2064, 2065]. In the hightemperature limit withπT ≫µi,mi,ΛQCD, the abovethree scales are the only ones appearing and the twonon-trivial scalesmmagnetic and melectric are connectedtothestaticsectorcorrespondingtothezeroMatsubaramode (n= 0 ). As a result, in the effective field theorylanguage it is natural to integrate out the hard scale,yielding a three-dimensional effective field theory whichis valid for long-distance static field modes. Anotherway to see this is recognize that, in four-dimensionalEuclidean space, a system in thermal equilibrium hasits time direction compactified to a circle of radius1/T[2050]. In the high-temperature limit, the Euclideantime direction has zero extent and the parent field the-orybecomeseffectivelythreedimensional.Sincefermionicmodes have odd Matsubara frequencies, they becomesuper massive and decouple from the theory in thislimit, as do all non-zero gluonic Matsubara modes.
The construction of dimensionally reduced effectivetheories for high-temperature field theory began withthe work of Ginsparg [2081] and was quickly followedby Appelquist and Pisarski [2082]. In the mid-1990s,Kajantie et al. were the first to apply this formalismto the study of the electroweak phase transition [2083].
Around the same time Braaten and Nieto demonstratedhow to apply these ideas to thermal QCD [2064, 2065].
Recently, these methods have been extended to thecomputation of the thermodynamics ofN = 4 super-symmetric Yang-Mills theory to orderλ2, where λ =g2Nc is the t‘Hooft coupling [2084].6.5 Hard thermal loop effective theory 233In the EFT technique, the Lagrangian densities ofthe three- and four-dimensional theories can be ob-tainedbywritingdownthemostgenerallocalLagrangiansrespectingallnecessarysymmetries.Onethenordersalloperatorsintermsoftheirdimensionalityandtruncatesthe Lagrangians at the desired order. For electrostaticQCD (EQCD), this procedure results in [2064, 2065]LE = 12TrF2ij + Tr[Di,A0]2 + m2ETrA20+λ(1)E (TrA20)2 + λ(2)E TrA40+iλ(3)E TrA30 + ··· , (6.5.5)where the adjoint fieldsAi ≡AAi TA, A0 ≡AA0 TA arethreedimensional, FAij = ∂iAAj −∂jAAi +gEfABCABi ACj ,Fij ≡FAijTA, andDi = ∂i−igEAi. Integrating out thetemporal gauge field, one can obtain the magnetostaticeffective theory (MQCD) withLM = 12 TrF2ij + ··· andFAij = ∂iAAj −∂jAAi + gMfABCABi ACj [2064, 2065].
At leading order in g, the degrees of freedom inthe above effective theories are the n = 0 Matsub-ara modes of the four-dimensional Ai and A0 fields.
The former transforms as a three-dimensional adjointgauge field and the latter as a scalar in the adjointrepresentation of SU(Nc). By computing the contribu-tions from the hard scale in the four-dimensional the-ory (non-resummed), the massless two-loop self-energyin the four-dimensional theory, and the massive three-loop vacuum graphs and matching the two theories, oneobtains the following result for the QCD free energythrough O(α5/2s )FQCDFideal= 1 −154αsπ + 30(αsπ)3/2+1352(log αsπ −1136 log Λ2πT + 3.51)(αsπ)2+4952(log Λ2πT −3.23)(αsπ)5/2+ O(α3slog αs) ,(6.5.6)where Fideal = −(8π2/45)T4 is the free energy of anideal gas of massless gluons andαs = αs(Λ) is the run-ning coupling constant in theMS scheme. Note, impor-tantly, the appearance of non-analytic terms inαs. Log-arithms ofαs appear as ratios of the electric screeningscale over the temperature. In order to avoid notationaloverlap with the chemical potentialµ, hereΛis used toindicate the renormalization scale. There is also a resid-ual dependence on the renormalization scaleΛat ordersα2s and α5/2s . The result obtained when this expressionis truncated at various orders in the coupling constantis shown in Fig.6.5.1. As can be seen from this figure, atphenomenologically relevant temperatures the resultingweak coupling expansion shows poor convergence andan increasing sensitivity to the renormalization scale asFig. 6.5.1 Naive weak-coupling expansion of the scaled QCDpressure forNf = 3 .

the perturbative truncation order is increased. The rea-son for this poor convergence is that one is expandingaround the T = 0 QCD vacuum, which does not in-clude the effects of Debye screening and Landau damp-ing. In order to improve the convergence of this series,HTLpt was introduced to reorganize the calculation in-stead around the T →∞ limit. We will discuss thisreorganization in the next subsection.

The HTLpt Lagrangian (6.5.7) reduces to the QCDLagrangian when δ = 1 .

Inordertoobtainanalyticallytractablesum-integrals,in addition to the δ expansion, one must also makea Taylor expansion in the mass parameters scaled bythe temperature,mD/T and mq/T. The final result ob-tained at NNLO is completely analytic, however, it istoo lengthy to list here, instead we refer the reader tothe most recent works using HTLpt, which apply thistechnique at finite temperature and quark chemical po-tentials [2078, 2079, 2091]. In Fig.6.5.2 we compare theNNLO EQCD and HTLpt results for the scaled pres-sure (negative of the free energy). As can be seen fromthis figure, for the central choice of the renormalizationscale, namelyΛg = 2πT andΛq = πT, there is excellentagreement between HTLpt and the lattice data. Thesame is true to a lesser extent for EQCD. Both, how-ever, have a large uncertainty related to the variationwith respect to the renormalization scale. This sensi-tivity is particularly large for the free energy; howeverother quantities show much less renormalization scaledependence. From the NNLO results, one can obtainpredictions for various quark and baryon number sus-ceptibilities.
In Figs.6.5.3-6.5.5 we present the NNLO resummedperturbative predictions for the second-order baryonnumber susceptibility, the fourth-order baryon numbersusceptibility,andthefourth-orderlightquarksuscepti-bility, respectively. As these figures demonstrate HTLptand EQCD to a only slightly lesser extent, have reason-able agreement with lattice extractions of these suscep-tibilities down to temperatures on the order of T ∼250 MeV which is only slightly higher than the QCDphase transition temperature of Tc ∼155 MeV. Thelone exception isχB(u)2 where EQCD seems to performbetter than HTLpt, although the results are consistentwithin the scale uncertainties. Finally, in Figs.6.5.6and6.5.7we present results recently presented in Ref. [2091]for the second- and fourth-order curvatures of the QCDphasetransitionlineobtainedfromtheanalyticalNNLOHTLpt result and the world’s compiled lattice QCDdata. We display three different physical cases whichcorrespond to (1) equal quark chemical potentials, (2)zero strange quark chemical potential, and (3) the case⟨S⟩= 0 and Q/B = 0.4, which corresponds to the caseappropriate to heavy-ion collisions. As can be seen fromthese figures, NNLO HTLpt agrees quite well with theexisting lattice data in each case. The horizontal errorbars (which are sometimes not even visible) indicate therenormalization scale dependence of these curvatures.
To close this section, we have demonstrated that al-though naive perturbative expansions applied to QCDthermodynamics fail dramatically, it is possible reorga-nize the calculation of the QCD free energy in such away as to achieve improved convergence at phenomeno-logically relevant temperatures. Interestingly, we findexcellent agreement between the resummed approachesand lattice data down to rather low temperatures andare even able to predict the curvature of the QCD phasetransition line using perturbation theory.
6.6 EFT methods for nonequilibrium sys-temsMiguel Escobedo6.6.1 IntroductionThere are many situations in which we are interestedin describing non-equilibrium phenomena that involvethe strong interaction. An example is the study of themedium created when colliding heavy ions at ultrarel-ativistic speeds. This kind of experiment is nowadaysperformed at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) in Geneva and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Col-lider (RHIC) in Brookhaven.The motivationis to studyanewstateofmatterthatappearsathightemperaturesand densities, the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). Moredetails are given in section 4.4. The medium createdin heavy ion collisions can be regarded as an out-of-equilibrium system. Soft particles in the medium areable to approximately thermalize [2092, 2093]; however,this thermalization is only local. Looking at length andtime scales much larger than the inverse of the tem-perature the bulk properties of the medium are welldescribed by relativistic hydrodynamics [2094–2096].
One important way to obtain information about theQGP created in heavy ion collisions is by studying itseffects on hard probes, for example, heavy quarkonium236 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESRe tIm tFig. 6.6.1Schwinger-Keldysh contour of the real time formal-ismsuppression and jet quenching [1561, 2097]. We can re-gard these particles as out-of-equilibrium probes inter-acting with a thermal equilibrium environment of softparticles. Precisely because they do not have time tothermalize inside of the medium, they allow us to char-acterize the QGP in a way that would not be possibleotherwise. For example, they are sensitive to transportproperties of the medium such as the heavy quark diffu-sion coefficient [2098] and the jet broadening parameterˆq[2097]. Note also that the problem of a hard probe in-teracting with a soft medium is one in which a hierarchyof well-separated energy scales appear. This is preciselythe situation in which EFTs are useful. In summary, thestudy of hard probes in heavy ion collisions provides aclear motivation to study EFTs far from equilibrium.
The theoretical description of a QFT out of equilib-rium requires the use of the real-time formalism [2099].
When dealing with T = 0 scattering process, we areused to assuming that the system is in the ground stateboth at the remote past and in the distant future. Thisis what is done to obtain the LSZ reduction formula[2100]. The consequence of this is that, when comput-ing amplitudes, all field insertions are chronologicallyordered. The situation is completely different when theinitial state of the system is described by a given den-sity matrix. In this case, the state of the system inthe distant future is unknown, so we have to averageover all the possible outcomes imposing that the sys-tem is described by the initial density matrix in theremote past. For this reason, the real-time formalism issometimes called anin-in formalism while the formal-ism leading to the LSZ reduction formula is called anin-out formalism. As a consequence, the path integralneeds to go from the remote past to the distant futureand back again around a path called the Schwinger-Keldysh contour (see Fig. 6.6.1) [2099]. Fields in theupper (lower) branch of the contour are chronologi-cally (anti-chronologically) ordered and are customarylabelled fields of type 1 (2).71The doubling of degrees of freedom discussed in theprevious paragraph can affect the construction and useof an EFT in two different ways depending on whetheror not medium degrees of freedom are integrated outwhen going from the full theory to the EFT. If thematching is not affected by the medium, then we canapply the real time formalism in exactly the same wayasitisdoneforanormalQFT.However,ifthematchingis affected by the medium, we can not assume that theEFT does not contain terms mixing the two branches ofthe Schwinger-Keldysh contour. Recently, this issue hasbeen discussed in detail in the context of the construc-tion of an EFT for hydrodynamics [2101–2104]. How-ever, regarding the study of hard probes, the compli-cations arising from the doubling of degrees of freedomare substantially diminished when we take into accountthat only few of them are created in each heavy ion col-lision. We will discuss in detail how the dilute natureof heavy quarks and high-energy partons simplify theirstudy in the real time formalism.
Lastly, there is another aspect of the application ofEFTs to the study of hard probes out of equilibriumthat we would like to highlight. This is the connec-tion that naturally appears with the formalism of openquantum systems (OQSs) [2105]. The OQS formalismstudies the evolution of quantum systems interactingwith an environment, that at the same time is also aquantum system. The central object of study is the re-duced density matrix, obtained from the density matrixof the combination of the system plus the environmentafter performing a trace over the degrees of freedomof the environment. The evolution of the reduced den-sity matrix is not necessarily of the quantum Liouvilletype as there might appear terms that increase its vonNeumann entropy. It happens that, when studying hardprobes interacting with a medium using EFTs, one typ-ically finds equations that are well known in the contextof OQSs. This is not surprising since when we computehow thermal propagators influence the evolution of ahard probe we are actually making a trace over envi-ronment degrees of freedom.
In summary, in this section we are going to discussthe application of EFTs to study nonequilibrium phe-nomena.Inparticular,wewillfocusoninterestingprob-lems that appear in the study of heavy ion collisions inwhich a large separation of energy scales appear. First,we will review the open quantum system formalism.
This will allow us to discuss the Lindblad equation,which will play a key role in the later discussion. Then,71 From a complementary point of view, fields of type 1 (2)act on the left (right) of the density matrix.6.6 EFT methods for nonequilibrium systems 237we will discuss the application of EFTs to the studyof quarkonium suppression. More specifically, we willstudy the evolution of the reduced density matrix ofheavy quarks using pNRQCD. In another subsection,we will review the description of jet broadening basedon the study of the reduced density matrix using SCET.
Finally, we will review applications of the EFT to studyhydrodynamics and the interesting structure regardingthe doubling of degrees of freedom that have been dis-covered in this context.
6.6.2 Open quantum systemsLet us consider auniverse formed by a system plus anenvironment. Let us assume that at some initial timethe density matrix of theuniverse ρU(t0) fulfilsρU(t0) = ρS(t0) ⊗ρE(t0) , (6.6.1)where S corresponds to the system andE to the envi-ronment.Themotivationforthisassumptionistwofold.
On one hand, when studying a dilute hard probe inter-acting with a medium, it is natural to assume that themedium acts as a thermal reservoir that is not affectedbytheprobe. Onthe otherhand, evenif theassumptionis not true, any density matrix for theuniverse can bedecomposed as a sum of density matrices that do fulfilthis structure. The reduced density matrix at timet0 isalso ρS(t0).
ρS(t0) = Tr E(ρU(t0)) . (6.6.2)Let us now look at what happens att > t0. IfU(t,t0)is the time evolution operator of theuniverse, thenρU(t) = U(t,t0)ρU(t0)U†(t,t0) , (6.6.3)and it follows thatρS(t) = Tr E(U(t,t0)ρU(t0)U†(t,t0)) . (6.6.4)However, in general it is not true thatρS(t) ̸= US(t,t0)ρS(t0)U†S(t,t0) , (6.6.5)so in this sense we can say that the evolution is non-unitary.
The equation that describes the time evolution ofρSis called a master equation. In general, it is not trivialto determine the form of this equation. However, an im-portant result of the OQS formalism is that the masterequation of a Markovian evolution that preserves thefundamental properties of a density matrix (Hermitianpositive-definite operator with trace equal to1) takesthe form of a GKSL or Lindblad equation [2106, 2107]dρSdt = −i[H,ρS] +∑i(CiρSC†i −12{C†iCi,ρS}),(6.6.6)where Ci are the collapse or Lindblad operators. Theyare operators that encode the dissipative part of theLindblad equation and will depend on the problem wearestudying.Letusnotethatitisverycomputationallyexpensive to solve the GKSL equation, as it is gener-ally the case for any master equation. The reason isthat the cost scales withN2, where N is the dimen-sion of the Hilbert space. This means that, if we dis-cretize the QCD system in a lattice, doubling the latticesize multiplies the numerical cost by four. This problemcan be solved by using techniques called unravelling ofthe master equation. Examples of unravellings used tostudy quarkonium suppression are the Quantum StateDiffusion [2108] and the Quantum Trajectories method[1562, 2109–2111].
6.6.3 EFT s for quarkonium suppressionQuarkonium suppression was proposed as a probe ofthe formation of a QGP in the pioneering work of Mat-sui and Satz [2112]. The original proposal was basedon the phenomenon of colour screening. Chromoelec-tric fields are screened at large distances in the pres-ence of a QGP. This modifies the heavy quarkoniumpotential and, if the screening length is smaller thanthe size of the bound state, inhibits bound state forma-tion. Later on, it was realized that the potential devel-ops an imaginary part in the presence of a QGP [2113].
This is related to the appearance of a thermal induceddecay width which can dissociate quarkonium in manycases more efficiently than screening. However, beforeasking which phenomenon more substantially modifiesthe heavy quarkonium potential, we should understandwhether quarkonium’s evolution follows a Schrödingerequation at all in the presence of a medium and whatis the definition of the potential. In Sec.6.1, we haveseen that similar issues can be addressed using non-relativistic EFTs such as NRQCD and pNRQCD atT = 0 . Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that thefinite temperature versions of these EFTs will allow usto answer the previous questions.
InordertoconstructanEFT,weshouldfirstdiscussthe energy scales and the symmetries of the problem. Inaddition to the hard, soft and ultrasoft scales that al-ready appear when studying quarkonium atT = 0 , weshould also consider the energy scales induced by thepresence of the medium. One of the energy scales thatobviously appears is the temperature itself. However,in a weakly-coupled plasma (g≪1), other dynamicallygenerated energy scales appear. For example, the Debyemass (of ordergT) and the non-perturbative magneticmass (of order g2T). More details about these scales238 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIEScan be found in Sec.6.5. Depending on the relation be-tween the medium induce energy scales and those thatalready appear atT = 0 , we will find different physi-cal situations. For example, if the Debye mass is muchlarger than the inverse of the Bohr radius, there wouldbe no bound state formation due to screening. On theother hand, if the temperature is smaller than the in-verse of the Bohr radius, thermal effects are a pertur-bation compared with the binding energy because themedium sees quarkonium as a small colour dipole.
Regarding the symmetries of the problem, we willfocus on the scenario in which quarkonium is co-movingwith the medium. Note, however, that there are EFTstudies considering the finite velocity case [2114, 2115].
In the co-moving case, the medium only breaks Lorentzsymmetry. Note that inT = 0 NRQCD and pNRQCD,Lorentz symmetry is not explicit. It manifests throughrelations between the Wilson coefficients of different op-erators [1398, 1399]. These relations are broken in thepresence of a medium [2116].
Now, let us discuss how the doubling of degreesof freedom influences the use of non-relativistic EFTs.
First, consider the thermal equilibrium case. Since themassoftheheavyquark M ismuchlargerthanthetem-perature T, it follows that the thermal modifications ofthe heavy quark propagator in NRQCD or the singletpropagator in pNRQCD are suppressed by the Boltz-mann factor e−M/T. This reflects the fact that physi-cally heavy particles are dilute in a thermal equilibriummedium that has a temperature much lower thanM.
We are interested in the more general case in which theheavy particles are not in thermal equilibrium. How-ever, we will still consider that heavy particles are di-lute. This is clearly the case for bottom quarks at LHCsince only a few of them are produced in each heavyion collision.72. A direct consequence of the dilute limitis that the 12 propagator of a heavy particle is sup-pressed. This corresponds to a propagator involving afield of type 1 (upper branch of the Schwinger-Keldyshcontour) and a field of type 2 (lower branch). Therefore,if we are interested in Green’s functions involving onlyheavy quark fields of type 1, we can ignore the doublingof degrees of freedom and proceed in the same way aswe would do atT = 0 (the doubling of degrees of free-dom still affects the propagators of light particles). Thereason is that, in any Green’s function in which they ap-pear at the same time heavy fields of type 1 and 2, therewill appear at least one12 propagator. In conclusion,if we are interested in spectroscopy at finite tempera-ture, we can ignore the doubling of degrees of freedom.
72 The situation could be different for charm quarks. For pN-RQCD studies of the non-dilute limit for charmonium see [2117,2118]This is what we will do for the moment. Later on, wewill discuss the evolution of reduced density matrix ofquarkonium that involves discussing the12 propagator.
The first applications of NRQCD and pNRQCD atfinite temperature can be found in Reds. [1552, 1553].
Ref. [1552] considers the infinite mass limit while Ref.
[1553] discusses the Abelian analogue of quarkonium,the hydrogen atom. In both works the issue of the dou-bling of degrees of freedom is discussed in detail. Lateron,theresultsweregeneralizedtothecaseofrealquarko-nium [2119]. Let us summarize the main results foundby studying quarkonium spectroscopy at finite temper-ature using EFTs– The leading thermal effect can only be encoded as amodification of the potential when the Debye massmD is much larger thanE. In the EFT framework,we only talk about a potential when we are dealingwith an interaction that is non-local in space butlocal in time. When the conditionmD ≫E is notfulfilled, thermal corrections are sensitive toE in anon-polynomial way and this signals that the inter-action is non-local in time. In summary, potentialmodels are suitable whenmD ≫E.
– We can consider thermal effects a perturbation if1/r ≫T (where r is the radius). In this case, themedium does not modify the matchings from QCDto NRQCD and from NRQCD to pNRQCD. Themedium sees quarkonium as a small color dipole.
This manifests in the pNRQCD Lagrangian in thefollowingway.Thecouplingbetweenthesingletfieldsand the ultrasoft gluons of the medium is propor-tional to r. This implies that thermal effects are al-ways multiplied by a factor ofrT.
– In a qualitative way, we can say that quarkoniumdissociates at the temperature at which thermal ef-fects are of the same order of magnitude as thebinding energy. The logic behind this statement isthe following. If thermal effects are smaller thanthe binding energy, then they are a perturbation.
If thermal effects are much larger than the bindingenergy it is impossible for a bound state to exist.
Therefore, the transition between these two regimesmust be found when the thermal effects andE areof the same size. In the weakly-coupled scenario,the imaginary part of the potential is larger thanthe screening corrections to the real part. There-fore, dissociation occurs whenT ∼Mg4/3. At thistemperature, screening is a perturbation as it onlybecomes important whenT ∼mg. This is at oddswith the original proposal of Matsui and Satz [2112]in which the mechanism responsible for quarkoniumsuppression was believed to be color screening.6.6 EFT methods for nonequilibrium systems 239– There are two processes that contribute to the ther-mal decay width of quarkonium: gluo-dissociationand inelastic scattering with medium partons. Gluo-dissociation is the process in which a singlet stateabsorbsamediumgluonandbecomesanoctetstate.
It was first computed in Ref. [2120] using the Op-erator Product Expansions and the large-Nc limit.
Within pNRQCD, this process was studied in detailin Ref. [1555], where the expression of Ref. [2120]was generalized to a finite number of colors. Inelas-tic scattering with medium partons is a process inwhich a singlet scatters with a medium quark orgluon through the exchange of an off-shell gluon[1556]. Gluo-dissociation is a leading-order processinthecouplingconstantexpansionbutithasasmallerphase space since the gluon is required to be on-shell. The pNRQCD power counting correctly pre-dicts that gluo-dissociation is the dominant processif E ≫ mD. On the contrary, if mD ≫ E, it isinelastic parton scattering that dominates.
6.6.4 The master equation in pNRQCDPreviously, we have discussed the information that canbeobtainedfromthetime-orderedpropagatorofquarko-nium. This includes the values of the binding energiesand decay widths. However, since we were using thedilute limit, we did not obtain any information abouthow the density of heavy quarkonium evolves inside of amedium. This is needed in order to compute the prob-ability that a bound state is detected in a heavy-ioncollision.
The information about the density of heavy quarko-nium is contained in the12 singlet propagator of pN-RQCD. This is zero at leading order in the dilute limit;therefore, we need to go to next-to-leading order in thisexpansion;i.e.weneedtoconsideralldiagramsinwhichthe 12 propagator appears only once.
Untilnow,allofthestudiesconcerningtheevolutionof the density of heavy quarkonium inside a medium us-ing non-relativistic EFTs have focused on the1/r≫Tregime. In this case, we can use theT = 0 pNRQCD La-grangian as a starting point. It has been demonstratedthat computing the evolution of the12 singlet and octetpropagator gives a system of coupled equations that re-sembles very closely the master equations that appearin the OQS framework [1559, 1560]. This is not surpris-ing, because we can regard ⟨S1(t,r1)S†2(t,r2)⟩as thereduced density matrix of heavy quarks projected intothe sub-space in which there is a singlet state. In gen-eral, the master equation is a complex non-Markovianequation. However, there are two limits in which sim-pler Markovian equations can be obtained. These limitsare the ones that have been studied up to now in phe-nomenological applications.
In the limit1/r ≫T,mD ≫E, we obtain a Lind-blad equation in which all of the information about themedium is encoded in two non-perturbative parame-ters, κ and γ. This equation has been used to pre-dict the nuclear modification factor in heavy ion col-lisions using as additional input the initial distributionof heavy quarkonium previous to the formation of theQGP and how the temperature evolves with time. How-ever, early studies were limited due to the high compu-tational cost. This problem was solved by the applica-tion of the Monte Carlo wave function method [2109].
Thanks to this, it was possible to combine the solutionof the master equation with state-of-the-art modellingof the time evolution of the medium to obtain resultscompatible with the observations at LHC [1562, 2109].
Another interesting limit is the one in which ther-mal effects are much smaller than the binding energy.
In this case, we can use the rotating wave approxima-tion,which assumes only the diagonal elements of thedensity matrix in the basis that diagonalizes the lead-ing order Hamiltonian need be considered. Using this,the master equation simplifies into a Boltzmann equa-tion [2117, 2118]. Moreover, using the molecular chaosassumption, it is possible to use the derived formulasoutside of the dilute limit. Thanks to this, the authorsof Refs. [2117, 2118] were able to successfully reproduceexperimentaldataforcharmoniumsuppressionatLHC.
The application of pNRQCD to the computation ofthe nuclear modification factor has been a very activeand successful approach in recent years. However, atthe moment, all of the studies have focused on the case1/r ≫T for the reasons discussed in the introduction.
This limits the applicability of the approach to excitedstates that are expected to be of larger size. In subsec-tion 6.6.6 we are going to discuss some recent develop-ments that might be used to improve the situation.
6.6.5 EFT description of jet broadeningA jet is a collimated ensemble of particles with a largemomentum and a small opening angle. They are use-ful in the context of QCD because the definition of ajet is constructed in such a way that the sensitivityto non-perturbative low-energy physics is minimized.
More details can be found in Secs. 6.4 and 11. Theinterest in jets in heavy-ion collisions is due to a phe-nomenon called jet quenching [2097]. Jets lose energywhen traversing a QGP. Therefore, by observing howopaque the medium is to high-energy particles allowsus to infer some of its properties.240 6 EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORIESJets might lose energy due to two different mecha-nisms: collisional and radiative energy loss. In the firstcase, the jet loses energy because it collides with theparticles forming the medium. In the case of radia-tive energy loss, the collisions in the medium providethe high energy parton with additional transverse mo-mentum and virtuality (a process called jet broaden-ing). Due to this increase, the high energy parton ismore likely to radiate energy outside of the jet cone.
The amount of virtuality that a parton gains whiletraversing a given length in the medium is controlled bythe transport coefficientˆq. At the moment, it is gener-ally believed that radiative energy loss is the dominantmechanism at high momentum while at low momentumboth processes have to be taken into account.
The problem of a high-energy parton traversing amedium is one in which widely separated energy scalesappear. First, we have the energyQof the high energyparticle. This is the highest energy scale that appearsin the problem. Additionally, we have the transversemomentum of the particlep⊥. If we use light-cone co-ordinates, withp± = ( p0 ±p3)/√2, and we choose the3 direction such thatp+ ∼Q, then an on-shell particlemust havep− ∼p2⊥/Q ≪p⊥. On top of this, we haveto consider the energy scales induced by the presenceof the medium, which by construction are always muchsmaller thanQ. The EFT that is suitable to study thisproblem is SCET (see Sec.6.4). Note that Glauber glu-ons (those with momentump = ( p+,p−,p⊥) of order(T,T 2/Q,T)) play a prominent role in the physics ofa jet traversing a medium. Inclusion of Glauber gluonsin the SCET formalism was discussed in Refs. [1815,2121]. A more recent and extended discussion can befound in Ref. [1810].
There have been many studies of jet quenching us-ing SCET [2122] and jet broadening [1814, 1817]. Incontrast to the case of quarkonium suppression, at themoment all applications use SCET as a starting point,without constructing an EFT in which medium de-grees of freedom have been integrated out. This maybe due to the fact that there is no information relevantto jet quenching in the time ordered propagator of ahigh energy particle. Instead, we need to focus on thedistribution of high-energy particles that requires anapproach similar to the study of the12 propagator ofheavy quarkonium. Some of the results that have beenobtained from the application of SCET to the study ofjet quenching are the following:– The non-perturbative expression ofˆq in terms of anexpectation value of gauge fields was re-obtained inRef. [1814] for the case of a Feynman or Coulombgauge and generalized to a gauge invariant expec-tation value in Ref. [1817]. This result is impor-tant because it allows one to computeˆq using non-perturbative approaches such as lattice QCD.
– The use of SCET including Glauber gluons made itpossible to derive a medium-modified parton showerin a model in which the medium is approximated asan ensemble of static scattering centers [1815, 2121].
Inrecentyears,SCEThasbeencombinedwiththeOQSapproach to study jet quenching [1818, 2123] similarlyto how pNRQCD was combined with OQS to studyquarkonium suppression. In this case, one considers ahigh-energy particle (system) that is interacting withthe soft particles that comprise the medium (environ-ment). The interaction between the two is mediated bythe Glauber part of the SCET Hamiltonian [1810]. Theevolution of the reduced density matrix of the system(high-energy particle) has been studied first ignoring allradiation (only considering jet broadening) [1818] and,later on, incorporating the leading-order radiative cor-rections [2123]. In both cases, a master equation of theLindblad type is found. The advantages of proceedingin this way is that the information about the mediumis encoded in expectation values of gauge invariant op-erators of soft fields. This allows separating the physicsof jet-medium interaction from the way in which themedium is modeled. In addition, it opens the way forfuture determinations of the influence of the mediumusing lattice QCD.
6.6.6 EFT s for hydrodynamicsWe have previously discussed the difficulties encoun-tered when constructing an EFT in which medium de-grees of freedom are integrated out. In a few words,terms that mix the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour appear and this changes the propertiesof the EFT in a profound way in comparison with theEFT at T = 0 . Let us summarize how this challengehas been avoided until now in the study of hard probesof the QGP:– In the case of quarkonium we could use the dilutelimit and focus on the time-ordered propagator. Inthis case, we know that the terms that mix the twobranches of the SK contour give a small contribu-tion and proceed as it is done atT = 0. The problemwith this is that there is valuable information thatcan not be obtained from the time-ordered propa-gator in the dilute limit, as for example, the nuclearmodification factor.
