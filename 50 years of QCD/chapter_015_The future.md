This last section of this volumedescribes the status and the prospects at new facili-ties which recently came into operation or which arepresently under construction.
The 12GeV project at JLab, presented by PatriziaRossi, is dedicated to a study of the structure of nu-cleons and nuclei, to an intense search for gluonic de-grees of freedom in meson and baryon spectroscopy, toa search for new physics in parity violating processes,and to a search for dark matter. The electron-ion col-lider (EIC) will provide electron-proton and electron-nuclei collisions at CM energies√s= 20–100GeV, laterpossibly up to 140GeV. Global properties and the par-tonic structure of hadrons and nuclei will be studied(Christian Weiss). The study of in-medium propertiesof hadrons and the nuclear matter Equation of State(EoS) and a search for possible signals of a deconfine-ment and a chiral-symmetry-restoration phase transi-tions are at the heart of the NICA (Nuclotron-basedIon Collider fAcility) program at the Joint Institute forNuclear Research in Dubna and of the J-PARC hadronfacility at Tokai. NICA provides beams of nuclei with4.5GeV per nucleon and protons up to 12.6GeV. Us-ing polarized beams, the internal structure of the pro-ton and deuteron will also be studied (Alexey Guskov).
Strange nuclear matter, hypernuclei and the study ofhyperons are further research areas (Shinzo Kumano).
The e+e− colliders in Beijing and Tsukuba had de-livered a large number of unexpected results. BES IIIwill increase further the statistics ofJψ from now1010and ψ(2S) (2.7 ·109) decays and extend its programto cover the full range up to 5.6GeV in mass. Mesonand baryon spectroscopy form the core of the programwith extensions to mesonic and baryonic form factorsand toτ decays (Hai-Bo Li, Ryan Edward Mitchell andXiaorong Zhou). The BELLE II program, presented byToru Iijima, has a strong part in spectroscopy as well.
The experiment operates at an asymmetrice+e− col-lider mostly at theΥ(4S) mass. In addition to the spec-troscopy program, BELLE III will search for non-SMcontributions in hadronic, semileptonic and leptonicb-quark decays, determine quark mixing parameters, de-termine parameters inτ physics to precisions and per-form searches for dark-sector particles. The new in-ternational Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research(FAIR), presently under construction at Darmstadt,is presented by Johan Messchendorp, Frank Nerlingand Joachim Stroth. Its program encompasses hadronphysics using anti-proton annihilation, heavy-ion re-actions at relativistic energies, and nuclear structurephysicsatthelimitofstabilityusingrareisotopebeams.
TheHigh-LuminosityLargeHadronCollider(HL-LHC)will have a five time larger luminosity than LHC. Ma-jor goals are improved tests of the Standard Model,searchesforbeyondtheStandardModel(BSM)physics,studiesofthepropertiesoftheHiggsboson,flavorphysicsofheavyquarksandleptons,andstudiesofQCDmatterat high density and temperature. Project and prospectsof HL-LHC are summarized by Massimiliana Grazziniand Tim Gershon.
14.1 JLab: the 12 GeV project and be-yondPatrizia Rossi14.1.1 Jefferson Lab and CEBAFJefferson Lab (JLab), is a US National Lab located inNewport News - Virginia. It is a world-leading researchlaboratory for exploring the nature of matter in depth,providing unprecedented insight into the details of theparticlesandforcesthatbuildourvisibleuniverseinsidethe nucleus of the atom. Its scientific program spans thestudy of hadronic physics, the physics of complex nu-clei, the hadronization of colored constituents, and pre-cision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.
Fig. 14.1.1 shows an areal view of the laboratory withthe accelerator complex in the foreground. The core ofJefferson Lab is the Continuous Electron Beam Accel-erator Facility (CEBAF). It operates as a pair of super-conducting radio frequency linear accelerators (linacs)in a “racetrack” configuration and is designed to circu-late a near continuous-wave electron beam through oneto five passes recirculating arcs (see Fig.14.1.2).
Jefferson Lab started physics operations in 1995,providing up to 6-GeV electron beams to three experi-mental halls, Halls A, B and C, simultaneously. In May2012, the 6-GeV beam operations were stopped, withJefferson Lab upgrading its facility to expand opportu-nityfordiscovery.Inadditiontotheacceleratorscopeofdoublingtheenergy,from6GeVto12GeV,theupgradeincluded the addition of a new fourth experimental hall,HallD,andtheconstructionofupgraded/newdetectorshardware in the other halls. In two of the existing hallsnew spectrometers were added, the large acceptance-device CLAS12 in Hall B [4319] and the precision mag-netic spectrometer Super High Momentum Spectrome-ter, or SHMS, in Hall C. The new experimental Hall D14.1 JLab: the 12 GeV project and beyond 495Fig. 14.1.1 Areal view of Jefferson Lab with the acceleratorcomplex in the foreground.
makesuseofataggedbremsstrahlungphotonbeamandsolenoidal detector to house the GlueX experiment.Theinitial energy upgraded program in Hall A made use ofboth the existing High Resolution Spectrometers.
The equipment in the four halls is well matched tothe demands of the broad 12 GeV scientific program[3127] with complementary capabilities of acceptance,precision and required luminosity: high luminosity inHalls A and C and large acceptance detectors in HallsB and D. The upgraded CEBAF accelerator, which candeliver a maximum energy of 12 GeV to Hall D and 11GeV to Halls A, B, C, delivered the first beam to HallsA and D in the spring of 2014. The full project wascompleted in spring 2017 with the commissioning ofthe two remainig halls.
In the meantime, Jefferson Lab has been continuingactively to invest in facilities that make optimum useof CEBAF’s capabilities and the existing equipment, toproduce science with high impact in Nuclear Physics aswell as High Energy Physics and Astrophisics. In Hall Athe Super Big Bite spectrometer (SBS) was installed in2021, while the Measurement Of Lepton-Lepton ElasticReaction (MOLLER) equipment is under constructionwith completion date foreseen for late 2026. On a longerterm, Hall A plans to host the SOLenoidal Large In-tensity Device (SoLID). Future additions include also:new large angle tagging detectors (TDIS in Hall A andALERT in Hall B); the neutral particle spectrometer(NPS) and the compact photon source (CPS) in HallC; and an intenseKL beamline that would serve newexperiments in the GlueX spectrometer in Hall D.

for more than 25 years. The capabilities of the upgradedCEBAF represent a significant leap over previous tech-nology, with an unmatched combination of beam en-ergy, quality and intensity. At Jefferson Lab experi-ments can run at luminosity up to1038 cm−2s−1 us-ing a highly polarized electron beam (up to 90%), highpower cryogenic targets, and several polarized targetsusing NH3, ND3, and3He to support a broad range ofpolarization measurements. This combination of beam,targets and large acceptance and high precision detec-tors, offers a powerful set of experimental tools thatenables unprecedented studies of the inner structure ofnucleons and nuclei and allows to push the limits of ourunderstanding of the Standard Model.
The facility serves an international scientific usercommunity of∼1700 scientists which, in collaborationwith the laboratory and with the guidance of the Jeffer-son Lab Program Advisory Committee (PAC), developsthe scientific program. Following the last PAC meetingin 2022, there are a total of 90 approved experiments inthe 12 GeV program117, of which more than 1/3 havereceived the highest scientific rating of A. There are 61approved experiments still waiting to run, representingat least a decade of running in the future. Furthermore,PAC meetings are expected to continue each summer,with a call for new proposals for beam time. Clearly,CEBAF is a facility in high demand.
The JLab physics program falls into four main cat-egories:– the study of the transverse, longitudinal and 3-dim-ensional structure of the nucleon through the mea-surements of the elastic and transition form factors(FFs), the (un)polarized parton distribution func-tions (PDFs), and the Transverse Momentum De-pendent (TMDs) and Generalized Parton Distribu-tions functions (GPDs), respectively.
117 A list of approved experiments is available on the JLabwebsite.496 14 THE FUTURE– The study of hadron spectroscopy and the search forexotic mesons to explore the nature of confinement.
– The study of the QCD structure in nuclei; its con-nection with the nucleon-nucleon interactions, in-cluding the modification of the valence quark PDFsin a dense nuclear medium, and the investigationof the quark hadronization properties. The neutrondistribution radius in medium heavy nuclei, is alsopart of the program.
– The search of physics beyond the Standard Modelin high-precision parity-violating processes and inthe search for signals of dark matter.
Due to the limited space, only few selected high-lights of the scientific agenda and present results of theJLab 12 GeV rich program are presented in this review.
Some key results of the earlier JLab 6 GeV program arealso reported for completeness when needed. The partrelated to the search of physics beyond the StandardModel,instead, are not discussed since it is somewhatbeyond the scope of this volume. A more complete sum-mary of the ongoing scientific program of the 12 GeVCEBAF and an outlook into future opportunities canbe found in Ref. [4320].
14.1.3 The structure of the nucleon.
For the theoretical formalism and a general overview ofthe structure of the nucleon, the reader should refer toSec. 10 of this volume.
Elastic Form Factors at high and ultra low Q2Since Hofstadter’s pioneering experiment in the ’50s,the measurements of the electromagnetic space-like nu-cleon FFs have been a crucial source of information forour understanding of the internal structure of the nu-cleons. In 2000 Jefferson Lab rewrote the textbook ofthe proton and neutron form factors when precise datafor the proton’s electric to magnetic form factor ratio,GpE/GpM from double polarization experiments at Q2up to 5.6GeV2[2916], didn’t show the scaling behaviorobserved using the Rosenbluth separation method andsubsequently confirmed by experiments with improvedprecision [2914],[4321]. According to the pQCD predic-tions the ratioQ2 F2pF1p, whereF1p and F2p are the Diracand Pauli form factors, respectively, would reach a con-stant value at high enoughQ2. The data clearly indi-cate that this asympvtotic regime has not been reachedyet.[2917]. These observations suggest the presence oforbital angular momentum in the leading 3-quark com-ponentofthenucleonwavefunctioninQCDRef.[ 2983].
Another explanation of this discrepancy has been at-tributed to “two–photon” exchange (TPE) or higherorder corrections to the cross sections. Jefferson Lab istackling these questions and in the coming years willoffer unprecedented opportunities to extend the cur-rent proton and neutron FF’s measurements to highermomentum transferQ2 and to improve statistical anduncertainties at very lowQ2, where the nucleon size canbe accurately investigated. The measurements at highQ2 will also contribute to constraint two of the nucleonGeneralized Parton Distributions, and in general willtest the validity of quite a few fundamental nucleonmodels in a region of transition between perturbativeand non-perturbative regimes.
One of the first completed experiments in Hall Awith the upgraded CEBAF accelerator was a precisionmeasurement of the proton magnetic form factor up toQ2 = 16GeV2[2904]. This experiment nearly doubledthe Q2 range over which direct Rosenbluth separationsof GE and GM can be performed. It confirmed the dis-crepancy with polarization measurements to largerQ2values and attributed it to hard TPE. These new, high-precision cross section measurement provides also animportant baseline for the nucleon form factors pro-gram.
A series of experiments [4322–4327] for the measure-ments of the proton and neutron magnetic and electricform factors, has started at the end of 2021 using theSuper Bigbite Spectrometer (SBS) and the upgradedBigBite Spectrometer in Hall A. This facility provideslarge acceptance at high luminosity so that small crosssections can be measured with high precision allowinga determination of the flavor separated form factors toQ2 = 10-12 GeV2. A complementary measurement ofthe neutron magnetic form factor will be performedwith CLAS12 in Hall B [4328]. The SBS form factorexperiments will push into aQ2 regions in which the-ory expects new degrees of freedom to emerge in ourunderstanding of QCD non-perturbative phenomena innucleon structure as predicted in Ref. [2983].
From the perspective of QCD in exclusive processes,another important measurement is accessing the struc-ture of the pion and kaon. The E12-06-101 experiment[4329]inHallCwillextractthepionformfactorthroughp(e,e′π+)n and d(e,e′π−)pp with Q2 extending to 6GeV2 from 2 GeV2 and −tmin ∼ 0.005 ∼ 0.2 GeV2.
The proposed separation of longitudinal and transversestructure functions is a critical check of the reactiondynamics. The charged pion electric form factor is atopic of fundamental importance to our understandingof hadronic structure. There is a robust pQCD predic-tionintheasymptoticlimitwhere Q2 →∞:Q2Fπ(Q2) →16παs(Q2)f2π. Therefore it is an interesting questionat what Q2 this pQCD result will become dominant.
The available data indicate that the form factor atQ2 = 2 GeV is at least a factor of 3-4 larger.

data will provide improved understanding of the non-perturbative contribution to this important property ofthe pion as well as mapping out the transition to theperturbative regime.
A high precision measurement of the elastic crosssection on the proton at ultra lowQ2, thePRad exper-iment, was performed in 2016 with the aim to solve theproton charge radius puzzle triggered by the muonichydrogen spectroscopic measurements. To improve theprecision of the measurement, the experiment utilizeda new type of windowless target system flowing the hy-drogen gas directly into the stream of CEBAF’s 1.1and 2.2 GeV electrons, and a calorimeter to detect thescattered electrons, rather than the traditionally usedmagnetic spectrometer. Moreover, the experiment wasable to measure the scattered electron at very low (Q2),facilitating a highly accurate extrapolation toQ2 = 0and extraction of the proton charge radius. The newvalue obtained for the proton radius is 0.831 fm [2901],which is smaller than the previous electron-scatteringvalues and is, within its experimental uncertainty, inagreement with recent muonic atomic spectroscopy re-sults.
To reach the ultimate precision offered by this newmethod, an enhanced version ofPRad, thePRad −IIexperiment [4330] has been approved. It will deliver themost precise measurement ofGpE reaching the lowestever Q2 value (10−5GeV2) in lepton scattering exper-iments, critical for the model independent extractionof rp. The projectedrp from PRad −II is shown Fig.
14.1.3 along with thePRad result, recent electron scat-tering extractions, atomic physics measurements on or-dinary hydrogen and muonic hydrogen, and the CO-DATA values (see [2901] for references of these mea-surements).
Quark parton distributions at high xThe quark and gluon structure of the proton has beenunder intense experimental and theoretical investiga-tion for more than five decades. Nevertheless, even forthedistributionsofthewell-studiedvalencequarks,chal-lenges such as the value of the down quark to up quarkratio at high fractional momentax (x ≥0.5), where asingle parton carries most of the nucleon’s momentum,remain. Recently, three JLab unpolarized DIS experi-ments, MARATHON [4331] in Hall A, BoNUS12 [4332]in Hall B, andF2d/F2p [4333] in Hall-C completed datataking. These experiments aim to provide data to con-strain PDFs in the high-x region, especially the d/uPDF ratio.
The experiments in Hall A and Hall B used two dif-ferent approaches to minimizing nuclear effects in ex-tracting the neutron information: MARATHON mea-sured the ratio of3H to 3He structure functions, whileBONUS12taggedslowrecoilingprotonsinthedeuteron.
The Hall-C experiment measured H(e, e’) and D(e, e’)inclusive cross sections in the resonance region and be-yond. While there will be nuclear effects in the deu-terium data, the experiment provides a significant largex range and reduced uncertainty to be combined withthe large global data set of inclusive cross sections forPDF extraction. Fig. 14.1.4 shows the MARATHONFd2 /Fp2 results [4331], along with data from the JLabBoNUSexperiment[ 3052]for W ≥1.84GeV/c2,evolvedtothe Q2 ofMARATHON,andresultsfromearlySLACmeasurements withW ≥1.84GeV/c2 [4334] presentedas a band. The results, which cover the Bjorken scal-ing variable range0.19 < x <0.83, represent a signifi-cant improvement compared to previous measurementsfor the ratio. The results are expected to improve ourknowledge of the nucleon PDFs, and to be used in al-gorithms which fit hadronic data to properly determinethe essentially unknown(u+ ¯u)/(d+ ¯d) ratio at large x.
A planned experiment using Parity Violation in DeepInelastic Scattering (PVDIS) [4335] on the proton, withthe proposed SoLID [4336] spectrometer, will provideinput on the d/u ratio at high x without contamina-tion from nuclear corrections by measuring the ratio ofγZ interference to total structure functions.
An extensive experimental program on spin physicsat low and moderate Q2, has been pursued by JLabduring the 6 GeV era. The main focus of the DIS ex-periments has been the x−dependence of virtal pho-ton asymmetryA1 = g1/F1, to determine the contribu-tions of quark spins to the spin of nucleon. In addition,the high statistical precision data and kinematic cov-erage allowed an accurate study of sum rules in theparton to hadron transition region as well as highertwist contributions (see Ref. [4337] for a review). A spinphysics program has been approved to run with the up-grade CEBAF which extends the kinematical coverageto higher x and can, among other things, answer the498 14 THE FUTUREkey question on what happens when a single quark car-ries nearly all (more than 80%) of the momentum of thenucleon. This region is well suited to test various theo-retical predictions including those from the relativisticconstituent quark model and perturbative QCD.

Combined with the currently runningexperiments to measure the proton and deuteron asym-metries Ap1 and Ad1 with CLAS12 [4329], new globalanalyses will be able to extract the∆u and ∆d quarkhelicity distributions in the high-x region with muchimproved precision.
Nuclear Femtography:TMDs and GPDsPioneering measurements to access Generalized Par-ton Distributions (GPDs) and Transverse MomentumDistributions (TMDs) were provided by the HERMES,COMPASS, and the JLab 6 GeV program, among oth-ers. For recent reviews see Refs. [4340, 4341]. The up-graded detectors and CEBAF beam energy and inten-sity,promisetoprovideamoredetailedthree-dimension-al (3D) mapping of the nucleon over wider ranges ofthe relevant kinematic variables. Indeed, this is a ma-jor thrust of the 12 GeV program accounting, so far,for almost ∼1/3 of the whole approved experimentalprogram.
Experimentally GPDs are accessible through deepexclusiveprocesses,themostprominentonesbeingDee-ply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS), and DeeplyVirtual Meson Production (DVMP). TMDs, at JLab,areaccessedthroughSemi-InclusiveDeepInelasticScat-Fig. 14.1.4 The Fd2 /Fp2 ratio versus Bjorken x from theJLab MARATHON experiment [4331], together with data fromBoNUS [3052] and a band based on the fit of the SLAC dataas provided in Ref.

tering (SIDIS), in which the nucleon is no longer intactand one or two of the outgoing hadrons are detectedin coincidence with the scattered lepton. GPDs andTMDs are not measured directly. They are extractedthrough global fits to experimental data of ComptonForm Factors (CFFs) for GPDs and Structure Func-tions for TMDs, and model dependent techniques withvariousassumptionsinvolved.Therefore,accessingthemdemands not only a structured connection between the-ory, experiment and phenomenology, but availability ofhigh precision data in a wide kinematical range andfromdifferenttargetsandseveraltarget/beampolariza-tion combinations. A 3D description of the nucleon in-ternal structure comes at the price of an unprecedentedcomplexity. Therefore, for a correct interpretation ofthe data and a detailed comparison between resultsand theoretical models, a full differential analysis, us-ing multi-dimensional information is crucial. The high-intensity, high-polarization electron beam provided byCEBAF with the complementary equipment of halls,A, B, C, makes JLab an ideal place for these studies.
SIDIS experiments provide access to the nucleonspin-orbit correlations. Observables are spin azimuthalasymmetries, and in particular single spin azimuthalasymmetries (SSAs), of the detected hadron. SSAs areduetothecorrelation betweenthequark transversemo-mentum and the spin of the quark/nucleon and earlymeasurements indicated that they become larger withincreasing x, i.e in the region where valence quarkshave visible presence. Measurements of SSAs at JLabwith the 6 GeV beam, performed with longitudinallypolarised NH3 [4342], and transversely polarised3He[3240] [4343] [3241] [4344] indicate that spin orbit cor-relations may be significant for certain combinations ofspins of quarks and nucleons and transverse momentumof scattered quarks.
Large spin-azimuthal asymmetries have been ob-served at JLab also for a longitudinally polarised beam[4345] and a transversely polarised3He target [4346],which have been interpreted in terms of higher-twistcontributions related to quark-gluon correlations andnovel aspects of emergent hadron mass. At JLab withupgraded energy, three experimental halls, A, B, and Care involved in TMDs studies. The measurements aimto access leading and higher twists TMDs and theirflavour and spin dependence, in multi-dimentinal bin-ning ofx,Q2,z,P T. The joint efforts of the three halls,where the high-precision, high-statistics measurementsin Hall A and C will be combined with the wide kine-matics ones performed in Hall B, by using differenttargets and several target/beam polarization combina-tions, will allow a thorough exploration of the 3D struc-ture of the nucleon in momentum space.

The sigleπ+production was measured over a wide range of kinemat-ics in a fully multidimensional study. The comparisonwith calculations shows the promise of high-precisiondata to enable differentiation between competing reac-tion models and effects.

14.1.5) demonstrates the impact of the beam energyon the phase space for production of multiple hadronsin the final state and the huge reduction in the corre-sponding error bars. Finally, the measured beam-spinasymmetries in back-to-back dihadron electroproduc-tion, ep →′ pπ+X, with the first hadron produced inthe current-fragmentation region and the second in thetarget-fragmentation region, provide a first access in di-hadron production to a previously unobserved leading-twist spin- and transverse-momentum-dependent frac-ture functions [4363].
A comprehensive program is carried out at JLabin deeply virtual exclusive scattering processes (DVCSand DVMP) with the goal to create the transverse spa-cial images of quarks and gluons as a function of theirlongitudinal momentum fraction in the proton, neutronand nuclei through the study of the GPDs. The phys-ical content of the GPDs is quite rich. Among otherfeatures, they give access to the contribution of the or-bital momentum of the quarks and gluons to the nu-cleon, and the D-term, a poorly known element of GPDparametrizations, which gives valuable insights to themechanical properties of the nucleon [2822, 4364–4366].
The study of the deeply exclusive processes and theGPDs extraction started, at JLab, in the 6 GeV era.
After the first publication by CLAS in 2001 [4367], aseries of high-statistics DVCS-dedicated experiments inHall A and B followed at moderateQ2 (1−3GeV2) andin a xB range centered aroundxB ∼0.3 (for a recentreview see[4368]).
The polarized and unpolarized cross sections mea-sured at in Hall A at 6 GeV [4369, 4370] indicate, viaa Q2-scaling test, that the factorization and the hy-pothesis of leading-twist dominance are valid alreadyat relatively lowQ2 (∼1 −2GeV2) and thus the appli-cabilityoftheGPD-baseddescription.Coveringarangein xB from 0.1 to 0.7 and inQ2 from 1 to 10GeV2, theupgraded JLab is very well matched to study GPDsin the valence regime. The program is executed in thethree experimental halls, A, B, C, and aims to measureaccurately fully differential beam-polarized cross sec-tion differences and unpolarized cross sections, longi-tudinally polarized target-spin asymmetries along withdouble polarization observables.
The first result of the 12 GeV era was reported byHall A on the DVCS cross section measurement at highBjorkenxB off an unpolarized proton target [4371]. Thework presents the first experimental extraction of thefour helicity-conserving nucleon Compton Form Factors(CFFs)asafunctionof xB.Asimilarexperiment,whichwillcomplementthekinematiccoverageoftheHallA,isplannedtoruninHallCwiththeHMSandNPSin2024[4372]. In Hall B two experiments measuring DVCS offan unpolarized proton target at 11 GeV [4373] and 6.6and8.8GeV[ 4374]willallowalargerkinematicalcover-age, while the measurement of the beam-spin asymme-try off a deuteron target, with detected neutron, willallow to constrain the poorly known GPD E, relatedto the quark orbital angular momentum through theJi’s sum rule, and to perform the GPDs quark-flavorseparation. These experiments will release their resultssoon. Finally, an experiment using longitudinally polar-izedNH3 andND3 target [4329] is currently running inHall B and one has been proposed to use a transversely500 14 THE FUTUREpolarized proton [4375]. The precision and kinematicalcoverage of these asymmetries obtained with differentcombination of targets and polarization will bring strin-gent constraints to GPD parametrizations.
Meson production at JLab at 6 GeV has not yetshown parton dominance of scattering. Experimentaldata from 11 GeV beam will provide important test ofthe deep-exclusive meson production mechanism. HallA recently published deep exclusive electroproductionof π0 at highQ2 [4376] using the 11 GeV beam off anunpolarized proton target. The results suggest the am-plitude for transversely polarized virtual photons con-tinues to dominate the cross section throughout thiskinematic range. Experiments have also been approvedin Hall B forπ0, η [4377] andφ production [4378], thelatter with the hope to determine the t-slope of thegluon GPDs. In Hall C, it is important to mention theprecise measurement of the L/T separation on kaonand pion electroproduction [4379, 4380] and the neu-tral pion cross-section measurements [4372].
Finally, DVCS and DVMP will be measured on the4He nucleus (with emphasis onφ production) [4381],with the aim of comparing a) the quark and gluon radiioftheheliumnucleus,b)GPDsoftheboundprotonandneutron with the free proton and quasi-free neutron.
While the most attention so far is on studies ofGPD using spin (beam/target) observables and cross-sections in DVCS, also the Time-like Compton Scat-tering (TCS), the time-reversal symmetric process ofDVCS where the incoming photon is real and the out-going photon has large time-like virtuality, has much tooffer. The first ever measurement of TCS on the pro-ton γp →p′γ∗(γ∗ →e+e−) has been obtained withCLAS12 [2824]. Both the photon circular polarizationandforward/backwardasymmetriesweremeasured.Thecomparison of the measured polarization asymmetrieswith model predictions points toward the interpreta-tion of GPDs as universal functions. Fig.14.1.6 showsthe photon polarization asymmetryA⊙U as a functionof −t at the averaged kinematic point Eγ = 7 .29 ±1.55GeV; M = 1 .80 ±0.26GeV, compared with GPDsbased models.

One example is theπ1 state which has led to contro-versies. Experiments have reported two different hybridcandidateswithspin-exoticsignature, π1(1400) andπ1(1600),which couple separately to ηπ and η′π (for a reviewsee Ref. [2362]). This picture is not compatible withrecent Lattice QCD estimates for hybrid states, norwith most phenomenological models. A recent work bythe JPAC [4384] provides a robust extraction of a sin-gle exoticπ1 resonant pole, but no evidence for a sec-ond exotic state. The main goal of the GlueX exper-iment [4385, 4386] in Hall D is to search for exoticmesons, and together with CLAS12 MesonEx experi-ment [4387] in Hall B, to provide a unique contributionto the landscape of experimental meson spectroscopythrough the novel photoproduction mechanism previ-ously relatively unexplored. Utilizing a real, linearly-polarized photon beam in GlueX and quasi-real, low-Q2photons in CLAS12, this program covers a wide rangeof beam energies fromEγ = 3-12 GeV.
GlueX has already collected high-statistics, high-quality photoproduction data and published various re-sults on photoproduction cross sections for several sin-gle pseudoscalar mesons including theπ0, π−, K+, η, η′over a broad range of momentum transfer [4388–4391],focused on a quantitative understanding of the mesonphotoproduction mechanism. Polarization observables,such as spin-density matrix elements, provide also valu-able input for the theoretical description of the produc-tionmechanism,whichisessentialfortheinterpretationof possible exotic meson signals. Moreover, these stud-ies require a complete understanding of the detectoracceptance and efficiencies in fits to multi-dimensionaldata and therefore are essential for assessing the PartialWave Analysis (PWA) machinery.14.1 JLab: the 12 GeV project and beyond 501Fig. 14.1.7 Preliminary mass spectra and amplitude analysisresults from GlueX for the reactionsγp → η(′)π0p, with0.1 <−t< 0.3GeV2 and 8.2 5GeV2 [4395, 4396]. Theprogram comprises also the search of hybrid baryonswith constituent gluonic excitations, for which a richspectrum is predicted by Lattice QCD. Finally, manyhyperon spectroscopy measurements are expected fromthe GlueX and CLAS12 measurements, including theΞ and Ω [4397, 4398]. This program will be expandedby proposal to perform hyperon spectroscopy with theKL neutral kaon beam in Hall D, which was recentlyapproved by the PAC[4399].
Over the past several years there has been a re-newed interest in studying near-thresholdJ/ψ photo-production as a tool to experimentally probe importantFig. 14.1.8 GlueX results for theJ/ψ total cross section vsbeam energy, compared to the JPAC model with hypotheticalbranching ratios provided in the legend for P+c with JP =3/2− as described in Ref. [4404].
properties of the nucleon target related to its mass andgluon content. Moreover, in the beam energy region ofEγ = 9.4-10.1 GeV, theγp →J/ψp process can be usedto search, directly in a simple2 →2 body kinematics[4400–4403] for the pentaquark candidates,P+c (4312),P+c (4440), andP+c (4457), reported by the LHCb exper-iment but still under debate [2828, 2829]. JLab has anactiveJ/ψphysicsprogram.Thereareeitherpublished,ongoing, or planned futureJ/ψ experiments in each ex-perimental hall. The first measurement was performedby GlueX [4404] and is shown in Fig. 14.1.8 , withcurves depicting the strength of hypothetical Pc sig-nals. No structures are observed in the measured crosssection, however model-dependent upper limits are seton the branching ratio of the possiblePC →J/ψp de-cays. Preliminary results from theJψ−007 experimentin Hall C also observe noPc signal and will set morerestrictive limits on the branching ratio [4405]. In HallB analysis of data are ongoing [4406] and in Hall A anexperimenthasbeenapprovedtorunwithSoLID[ 4407].
14.1.5 QCD and NucleiNuclear interactions are described using effective mod-els that are well constrained at typical internucleondistances in nuclei but not at shorter distances. Thestrong component of the nucleon-nucleon potential as-sociated with hard, intermediate short-distance inter-actions between pairs of nucleons, called Short-RangeCorrelated (SRC) pairs, is a poorly understood parts ofnuclear structure and generates a high-momentum tailto the nucleon momentum distribution. The existenceand characteristics of SRC pairs are related to out-standing issues in particle, nuclear, and astrophysics,among which are the modification of the internal struc-ture of nucleons bound in atomic nuclei (the EMC ef-502 14 THE FUTUREfect) [4408] and the nuclear symmetry energy governingneutron star properties [4409].
The studies of SRCs are a sizeable part of the JLabprogram that started already in the 6 GeV era. Af-ter the initial observation of identical structure in thehigh-momentum components of nuclei at SLAC[4410],electron-scattering measurements at JLab have identi-fied the kinematic region where SRCs dominate[4411,4412] and mapped out the contribution of SRCs in vari-ous light and heavy nuclei relative to the deuteron[795,4413]. Data demonstrated also that the contributionis sensitive to details of the nuclear structure [4414,4415] rather than the previously assumed average nu-clear density [4416]. In addition, they showed a clearcorrelation between the contribution of SRCs [795] andthe size of the EMC effect [4414]. To study the isospindependence of the SRCs, measurements of two-nucleonknock-out were carried out. These experiments showeddominance ofnp-SRC pairs overpp and nn-SRC pairsby a factor of about 20 [796, 4417, 4418]. The resultwas confirmed in measurements of quasi-elastic knock-out of protons and neutrons from medium and heavynuclei [4419], and later through inclusive measurementsof the48Ca/40Ca cross section ratio [4420] taking ad-vantage of the target isospin structure.
Thefirstmeasurementusinganoveltechniquetoex-tract thenp/pp ratio of SRCs taking advantage of theisospin structure of the mirror nuclei3H and 3He wascarried out in the 12 GeV era[4421]. Thenp/ppSRC ra-tio obtained is an order of magnitude more precise thanprevious experiments, and shows a dramatic deviationfrom the near-total np dominance observed in heavynuclei (see Fig. 14.1.9). This result implies an unex-pected structure in the high-momentum wave-functionfor 3He and 3H. Finally, measurements atx >2 car-ried out with the 6 GeV beam, tried to establish thepresence of three-nucleon SRCs [795, 4422], but didn’tFig. 14.1.9Ratio of np-SRCs to pp-SRCs relative to the totalnumber of np and pp pairs, for the new inclusive data (redcircle), compared with previous measurements [4421].
come to a definitive conclusion. Experiment [4423] withthe 11 GeV beam will provide the first significant testby taking high-statisticsA/3He ratio data atx> 2 andQ2 =3 GeV2.
Determining the origin of the EMC effect, i.e. themodification of nuclear PDFs relative to the sum ofthe individual nucleon PDFs, is one of the major un-solved problems in the field of nuclear physics and isstill a puzzle after forty years. Measurement at Jlabat 6 GeV in light nuclei demonstrated the correlationbetween the size of the EMC effect and the contribu-tion of SRCs [795]. The JLab12 program addresses thethree open questions of the EMC effect:i) the isospindependence; ii) the spin dependence;iii) the configura-tion/distance dependence. The isospin dependence hasbeen investigated with the already mentioned experi-ment using mirror nuclei [4421]. Polarization measure-ments can also help to understand the origin of theEMC effect [4424, 4425]. An 11 GeV experiment willmeasure the EMC effect in polarized7Li [4426] withthe goal to distinguish between mean-field models withexplanations based on SRCs. Tagging of recoil nucleiin deep inelastic reactions will be used in [4427] to ad-dress pointiii). This is a powerful technique to provideunique information about the nature of medium mod-ifications, through the measurement of the EMC ratioand its dependence on the nucleon off-shellness.
There are several ways to study QCD in nuclei. Oneis through the hadronization process, a mechanism bywhich quarks struck in hard processes form the hadronsobservedinthefinalstate.Thisisapoorlyknownmech-anism and more insight can be obtained by systemati-callystudyingproductionofdifferentbaryonandmesontypes using large and small nuclear systems, and ob-serving the multi-variable dependence of observables,such as multiplicity ratios and transverse momentumbroadening. These studies started with CLAS at 6 GeV[4428] and will continue with CLAS12[4426].
Hadronpropagationinthemediumcanalsobestud-ied by searching for color transparency, where the final(and/or initial) state interactions of hadrons with thenuclear medium must vanish for exclusive processes athigh momentum transfers. Color transparency for pi-ons [4429] andρ mesons [4430] was observed at 6 GeVwhile the 11 GeV experiment [1331] ruled out colortransparency in quasielastic12C(e,e′p) up toQ2 of 14.2GeV2. These results impose strict constraints on modelsof color transparency for protons.
Measurements on nuclei which are directly relevantfor understanding aspects of astrophysics and neutrinophysics are also part of the JLab program. One of theearly experiments of the 12 GeV era was the measure-ments of inclusive quasi-elastic scattering and single14.1 JLab: the 12 GeV project and beyond 503Fig. 14.1.10 48Ca neutron minus proton radius (red square)versus that for 208Pb (blue square).

proton knockout on40Ar [4431, 4432].These data willallow for tests ofν−40 Arscattering simulations neededfor the DUNE experiment. Another experiment [4433]measured electron scattering from a variety of targetsand different beam energies in CLAS12 in order to testneutrinoeventselectionandenergyreconstructiontech-niques and to benchmark neutrino event generators.
Thanks to the intense and highly polarized CEBAFelectron beams, measurements of the parity-violatingelectron scattering asymmetry from 208Pb and 48Cahave demonstrated a new opportunity to measure theweak charge distribution and hence pin down the neu-tron radius in nuclei in a relatively clean and model-independentway.Aprecisemeasurementoftheneutronradius, and hence of the neutron skin thickness, helps toconstrain the density dependence of the symmetry en-ergy of neutron rich nuclear matter, which has implica-tions on neutron stars and supernova. The PREX-II ex-periment [4434] measured the ‘‘neutron skin thickness’’of 208Pb while CREX[4435] measured that of 48Ca.
For CREX, the extracted neutron skin can be directlycompared to microscopic calculations [4436] providinga bridge between medium nuclei ab initio calculationsand heavy nuclei Density Functional Theory calcula-tions. The extremely precise CREX measurement indi-cates a thin neutron skin around its nucleus, in contrastwith the PREX measurement which revealed a thickerskin (see Fig.14.1.10). This discrepancy is exciting andpresents the opportunity for further exploration to de-termine why there’s such a big difference between themedium-density calcium nucleus and the high-densitylead nucleus.
14.1.6 Future OpportunitiesWith a fixed target program at the ‘‘luminosity fron-tier,’’ up to 1039 cm−2s−1, and large acceptance de-tection systems, CEBAF will continue to offer uniqueopportunities to illuminate the nature of QCD and theorigin of confinement for decades to come. In fact, CE-BAF operates with several orders of magnitude higherin luminosity than the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) andexciting scientific opportunities using CEBAF beyondthe currently planned decade of experiments can pro-vide very complementary capabilities, even in the era ofEIC operations. A discovery science program utilizingCEBAF in the EIC era has been developing jointly be-tween JLab and its user community towards exploringboth the science and technical case for moving beyond12 GeV. A series of upgrades to increase luminosity, en-able positron beams, and double the energy of CEBAFis envisioned [4320].
– An increase in luminosity with modest detector up-gradeswillfacilitatedoubleDVCS(DDVCS)studiesin experimental Halls A and B. DDVCS can bringsignificant additional information to the three di-mensional imaging of the quark structure. This is aprocess with interaction rates a factor of 100 lowerthan DVCS. Therefore it is not viable at EIC andmust be studied using CEBAF.
– Positronbeams,bothpolarizedandunpolarized,areidentified as an essential ingredient for the hadronicphysics program at JLab, and they are importanttools for a precise understanding of the electromag-netic structure of the nucleon, in both the elasticand the deep-inelastic regimes. Proof of principle ofa new concept for creating polarized positron beamsat CEBAF has been demonstated and a scinetificprgram has been developed [4437].
– Encouraged by recent success of CBETA at Cornell,a proposal was formulated to increase the CEBAFenergy from the present 12 GeV to 20-24 GeV byreplacing the highest-energy arcs with Fixed FieldAlternating Gradient (FFA) arcs but using the ex-istingCEBAFSRFcavitysystem.Thisexcitingnewtechnology would be a cost-effective method to dou-ble the energy of CEBAF, enabling new scientificopportunities in meson spectroscopy and extend-ing the kinematic range of nucleon imaging stud-ies. Technical studies of the implementation of FFAtechnology at CEBAF are in progress.
14.1.7 ConclusionsJefferson Lab is a world-leading research laboratory forexploring the nature of matter in depth. Its powerful504 14 THE FUTUREexperimental program at 12 GeV will advance our un-derstanding of the quark/gluon structure of hadronicmatter, the nature of Quantum Chromodynamics, andthepropertiesofanewextendedstandardmodelofpar-ticle interactions. CEBAF at Jefferson Lab is a facilityin high demand due to its unique capability to operatewith a fixed target program at the “luminosity frontier”up to 1039cm−2s−1, with exciting scientific opportu-nities beyond the currently planned decade of experi-ments. Potential upgrades of CEBAF and their impacton scientific reach are being discussed, such as higherluminosity, the addition of polarized and upolarizedpostron beams, and doubling the beam energy. Theywill keep CEBAF uniquely capable of a large num-ber of important measurements in nuclear and hadronicphysics.
14.2 The EIC programChristian W eissThe Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven Na-tional Lab (BNL) is planned as a next-generation facil-ity for high-energyep/eA scattering experiments sup-porting basic research in hadronic/nuclear physics andQCD. The design combines the RHIC superconduct-ing proton/ion accelerator ring with an electron storagering in the same tunnel and an injector for on-energyinjection of polarized bunches and enables collisions atone (possibly two) interaction points (see Fig.14.2.1)[4438]. It providesep collisions at CM energies√s =20–100GeV,upgradableto140GeV,usingvariouscom-binations of beam energies; foreA collisions with thesame setup the CM energy per nucleon is lower by afactor√Z/A. It is projected to achieve peak luminosi-ties in the range∼1033–1034 cm−2 s−1 and deliver anintegrated lifetime luminosity∼10–100 fb−1. It accel-erates ion species including the proton (p), light ions(D, 3He, others), and heavy ions (Au, U, others). Po-larization is available for the electron and the light ionbeams (p and 3He) with an average ion polarization∼70%. The EIC will be the first colliding beam facil-ity enabling electron collisions with ion beams (A> 1),and with polarized proton/ion beams. Its luminositywill exceed that of the HERAep collider by 100-1000.
As such it will provide qualitatively new capabilities forphysics research [3105].
The concept of a polarized electron-ion collider wasinspired by the results of the fixed-target spin physicsexperiments (CERN, SLAC, DESY), the DESY HERAep collider, and the BNL RHIC polarizedpp and AAcollider, and motivated by advances in theoretical con-cepts for hadron structure and high-energy QCD. Thedevelopmentsbeganwithplanningexercisesinthe1990sand advancedthrough extensive community efforts (sci-ence studies, program development) [820, 3128] andtechnical design work (accelerator, facility) at BNL,JLab, and other laboratories in the 2000s and 2010s.
Important milestones were the recommendation in 2015Nuclear Science Advisory Committee Long-Range Plan[4439] and the endorsement by a study of the U.S. Na-tional Academy of Sciences 2018 [4440]. The EIC wasgranted Critical Decision Zero (CD-0) by the U.S. De-partment of Energy in December 2019 and is now anofficial project of the U.S. Government. It is executedaccording to project management principles and passedCD-1 in 2021. Completion of construction and begin ofoperations are expected around 2034.
The EIC will enable a comprehensive science pro-gram aimed at understanding hadrons and nuclei asemergent phenomena of QCD. Scattering experimentswill be performed at momentum transfersQ2 ∼101-102GeV2, corresponding resolution scales where the quarkand gluon degrees of freedom are manifest and methodsof QCD factorization can be applied (see Fig.14.2.2).
The partonic content will be sampled at momentumfractions down to x ∼10−3–10−4, where gluons andsea quarks are abundant and dominate hadron struc-ture. The wide kinematic coverage will enable studyof scale dependence and radiation processes buildingup the parton densities, which provide essential insightinto the dynamics.

The EIC science program is organized in four broadthemes, defined by basic physics questions and conceptsthat are explored using various measurements:– Global properties and partonic structure of hadrons– Multi-dimensional imaging of hadrons and nuclei– Nuclear high-energy scattering in QCD– Emergence of hadrons from QCDThe boundaries between them are not strict, as somemeasurements serve to answer questions in more thanone area. In the following we briefly summarize the ob-jectives and main measurements in each of the themes;further information can be found in Refs. [820, 3105,3128].118 The program and its organization are stillevolving; new topics are being discussed and proposedin response to developments in theory and detector de-sign.
14.2.1 Global properties and partonic structureOne basic objective is to understand how the globalproperties of hadrons such as spin, mass, charges, andothercharacteristicsemergefromthequark/gluonfieldsofQCDandtheirinteractions(seeSec. 10.3).Thequan-tities are expressed as matrix elements of QCD com-posite operators between hadronic states,⟨h|OQCD|h⟩,118 The literature supporting the concepts and measurementsof the EIC physics program is very extensive. In this summarywe refer to the other sections of the review article for conceptsand previous results whenever possible; we refer directly to theliterature for simulation and impact studies for the EIC, andfor topics not covered elsewhere in the review.

some of which can be measured in deep-inelastic pro-cesses. For some quantities the operators have a par-tonic interpretation, and the matrix elements and canbeexpressedasintegralsofthePDFs/GPDs(sumrules).
For other quantities the operators involve interactions(higher twist), and the interpretation is more indirect.
The EIC will advance this program through severalmeasurements:Gluon polarization and nucleon spinThe quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spinare expressed as the integrals of the quark and gluonspin PDFs, which are measured in various polarizedscattering experiments (see Sec. 10.3). Despite mucheffort, the contributions to the spin sum rule are stillpoorly known. While fixed-target DIS measurementshavedeterminedthequarkspindensities,andtheRHICspin program has provided evidence of nonzero gluonspin, the distributions are known with good precisiononly atx≳ 0.01, so that the integrals suffer from largeuncertainties (see Sec.10.2). At EIC, measurements ofinclusive polarizedepDIS will accurately determine thequark and gluon spin densities down tox≳ 10−4. Thewide kinematic coverage will make it possible to deter-mine the gluon spin density indirectly through DGLAPevolution (see Fig.14.2.3) [3073, 3105, 3107]. Comple-mentary information will come from direct measure-mentsofthegluonspindensityusingdijetsorheavyfla-vor production [4441]. The gluon and quark spin PDFsextracted in this way will permit accurate evaluationof quark and gluon spin contributions to the spin sumrule. The results will also constrain the possible con-tribution of quark/gluon orbital angular momentum tothe nucleon spin (see Fig.14.2.4).506 14 THE FUTURECHAPTER 7.

tive neutron polarization in DIS [108, 109]. On-shell extrapolation in the protonmomentum eliminates nuclear modiﬁcations and ﬁnal-state interactions and per-mits the extraction of the free neutron structure functions [68]. Simulations showthat an accurate determination of the neutron double-spin asymmetry A k n is feasi-ble using polarized tagged DIS with on-shell extrapolation (see Fig. 7.16). Furtherapplications of tagged measurements are discussed in Sec. 7.3.8.
Orbital angular momentum contribution to nucleon spinThe improved constraints on the spin of quarks and gluons allow for exploring thecontribution to the proton spin due to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) ofthe partons. Figure 7.17 presents the potential of the EIC to constrain this contri-bution, which is identiﬁed with the difference between the quark and gluon spincontribution and the proton spin12. The horizontal axis shows the difference be-Fig. 14.2.4Room left for potential orbital angular momentumcontributions to the proton spin after determining the quarkand gluon spin contributions at EIC [3073, 3105].
Sea quark spin and flavor distributionsEqually important are the spin distributions of the seaquarks in the nucleon, which exhibit flavor dependence(∆¯u ̸= ∆¯d ̸= ∆¯s,∆s ̸= ∆¯s) and attest to flavor-dependent non-perturbative interactions with the va-lencequarksinthenucleon.Presentresultsontheflavordependence from fixed-target semi-inclusive DIS andthe RHIC W± production data show large uncertain-ties (see Sec.10.2). EIC will determine the polarized seaquarkdistributionsandtheirflavordependencethroughpolarized ep semi-inclusive DIS, taking advantage oflarge phase space for fragmentation (see Fig. 14.2.5)[3073,3105].ComplementaryinformationwillcomefromDISontheneutronmeasuredwithpolarized 3Hebeams.
The determination of the flavor structure of the polar-ized sea will also indirectly improve the extraction ofthe gluon spin distribution and the spin sum rule (sep-aration of flavor singlet and non-singlet distributions).
EIC will also enable novel studies of the flavor structureof the unpolarized sea using charged-current DIS.
Orbital angular momentumThe total angular momentum of quarks and gluons inthe nucleon can be expressed through integrals of theGPDs (see Sec.10.3). This representation provides al-ternative insight into the role of orbital angular mo-mentum in the nucleon spin decomposition. The GPDsappear in the amplitudes of hard exclusive processes(deeply virtual Compton scattering or DVCS, mesonproduction) and can be accessed experimentally in thisway; see Refs. [3185–3187, 4442] for a review. Whilethe hard exclusive processes sample the GPDs in a re-stricted domain of variables that is not sufficient forevaluating the angular momentum sum rule, it is possi-ble to establish a connection in the context of dynam-ical models of the GPDs, or a global analysis recruit-ing other data. EIC will advance this program throughmeasurements of DVCS and meson production over awide kinematic range; the same data will be used forthe 3D spatial imaging (see below).
Energy-momentum tensorOther global properties follow from the nucleon ma-trix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor andcan be studied by using the connection with scatteringprocesses. The D-term of the energy-momentum ten-sor, which expresses certain mechanical properties ofthe nucleon, appears as a subtraction constant in thedispersion relations for the DVCS amplitude and can beextracted from fits to DVCS data with minimal modeldependence; see Refs. [2825, 4443] for a review. EICmeasurements will allow one to precisely determine theD-term, taking advantage of the wide energy coverageof the data in evaluating the dispersion integral.
The trace of the QCD energy-momentum tensorcontains important information on the emergence ofthe nucleon mass from QCD; see Refs. [4444–4446] forrecent discussion and review. The breaking of scale in-variance through the UV divergences of QCD impliesthat the trace is proportional to the twist-4 gluonic op-erator G2µν (trace anomaly). An interesting question ishow much this effect contributes to nucleon mass. Ithas been suggested that the twist-4 gluonic operatorcould be accessed in exclusive photo/electroproductionof heavy quarkonia at near-threshold energies [4447–4449]; however, this connection relies on the question-able assumption of vector meson dominance [4450], andthe mechanism of heavy quarkonium production nearthreshold is a matter of current research and discus-sion; see e.g. Refs. [4451–4454]. EIC will contribute tothis program by measuring exclusiveΥ production nearthreshold (measuringJ/ψ production near threshold isvery challenging with the high-energy collider) [3105,4455]. With a future theoretical framework, these datawillconstrainthegluonicstructureofthenucleonatthehigher-twist level and contribute to the understandingof the origin of its mass.
Pion and kaon structureThe spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCDgenerates most of the light hadron masses and governsthe effective dynamics of strong interactions at low en-ergies (see Secs. 6.2 and 6.3). The pion and kaon arethe Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry, and theirquark/gluon structure provides insight into the micro-scopic mechanism of symmetry breaking.

Sea quark helicities via SIDISThe sensitivity on the struck parton that fragmentation functions provide can beused to leverage the understanding of the helicity structure of the nucleon — seealso Sec. 7.4.1 concerning the fragmentation functions themselves. In particular,the access to the sea quark helicities can be substantially improved over inclusiveDIS measurements via SIDIS measurements that detect pions and kaons in addi-tion to the scattered lepton. Detailed impact studies that use PEPSI as polarizedMC generator and follow the previous DSSV [88, 119, 120] extractions have beenperformed on the expected EIC measurements using various collision energies andpolarized proton as well as3He beams [87]. As can be seen in Fig. 7.19, the reduc-tion in the uncertainties of all three sea quark helicities (D¯u, D ¯d, Ds) in comparisonto the current level of understanding is substantial. Similar to the gluon polariza-tion, the highest impact at lowx relates to the data at the highest collision energieswhile intermediate to higherx receive the biggest improvements already from thelower collision energies. One of the most important points that can be answeredwith the sea quark helicities are their contributions to the spin sum rule. In particu-lar, the strange sea polarization is in current ﬁts forced to negative values at lowerxdue to the hyperon beta-decay constants and the assumption of SU(3)-ﬂavor sym-metry in conjunction with no indication of a negative polarization in thex-rangecovered in the currently existing data [121, 122]. The EIC SIDIS data will conclu-sively answer whether there is a nonzero strange polarization atx > 0.5⇥10 5.
Further studies using similar pseudodata together with a re-weighting techniqueon the NNPDFpol [123, 124] replicas come to similar conclusions about the im-provements to the sea quark helicities [125].

The extraction of pion/kaon structure fromep/eAscat-tering data requires theoretical methods that can betested with the EIC data.
14.2.2 Multidimensional imaging of hadrons andnucleiAnother basic objective is to understand and visualizehadrons as extended systems in space. This can be ac-complished using the concepts of GPDs (transverse co-ordinate space imaging) and TMDs (momentum spaceimaging), which provide a spatial representation con-sistent with the relativistic and quantum nature of thedynamics (see Sec.10.4). Measurements at EIC will al-low one to employ these concepts in regions where theyare practically applicable and realize their full poten-tial.
Transverse quark/gluon imaging of the nucleonThe transverse spatial distributions of quarks/gluonsand their dependence onxrepresent the size and shapeof the nucleon in QCD (see Sec.10.4 and Refs. [3186,3187] for a review) and contain rich information aboutdynamics (parton diffusion, chiral dynamics). ExclusiveJ/ψ electro- and photoproduction at EIC provides aclean probe of the gluon GPD and will determine trans-verse spatial distribution of gluons from thet-slope ofthe differential cross section (see Fig.14.2.6) [820, 3105,3128]. DVCS offers direct access to the quark GPDsand their spin dependence, and provides indirect infor-mation on the gluon GPD through NLO effects andQ2 evolution [3105, 4457]. The combination of bothwill allow for an accurate determination of the quarkand gluon GPDs, including validation of the factorizedapproximation and tests of the universality of the ex-tracted structures. Essential capabilities for this pro-gram are the kinematic coverage (probing quarks/glu-ons down tox ∼10−3, Q2 dependence in electropro-duction), luminosity (differential measurements, e.g.t-dependence at fixedx and Q2), far-forward proton de-tection (recoil, exclusivity), and beam polarization (po-larization observables). The results can be synthesizedin comprehensive transverse images of nucleon struc-ture (see Sec.10.4).
Transverse quark/gluon imaging of nucleiThe same concepts and measurements can be used tocreate images of nuclei (A> 1) in terms of quark/gluondegrees of freedom. Such studies provide new insightinto nuclear structure (comparison ofq−¯q, q+ ¯q, andgspatial distributions in the nucleus) and a new avenuefor studying nuclear modifications of partonic structure(comparison of nucleus with non-interacting ensembleof nucleons) [4458–4464]. EIC measurements of coher-ent J/ψ [4465] and γ production on nuclei probe the508 14 THE FUTURE126 7.2. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL IMAGING OF NUCLEONS, NUCLEI, AND MESONSments will also play a key role in the study of the ﬂavor structure of TMDs, whichis currently almost unconstrained [489], making it difﬁcult to estimate the impactof the EIC.
Quark Sivers and Collins measurementsFigure 7.53:Expected impact on up and down quark Sivers distributions as a function of thetransverse momentum kT for different values ofx, obtained from SIDIS pion and kaon EICpseudodata, at the scale of 2 GeV . The green-shaded areas represent the current uncertainty,while the blue-shaded areas are the uncertainties when including the EIC pseudodata.
Sivers function measurements: The determination of the quark Sivers functions,f ?q1T (x, kT), is one of the major goals for TMD physics. It can be extracted most di-rectly from the transverse SSA proportional to the sin(fh   fS) modulation of theSIDIS cross section, which is expressed through the structure functionFsin(fh fS)UT(see Eq. (7.27)). The Sivers function is a T-odd TMD [490], that turns into the Qiu-Sterman matrix element [212, 491] in the regime of smallb [492, 493]. The extrac-tion of the Sivers TMD was performed by many groups [494–506]. However, theFig. 14.2.7Expected impact of EIC pseudodata on the deter-mination of theuand dquark Sivers distribution [3105].

A new aspect oflight nuclei is that they cover a variety of spins (Spin-1 D, Spin-1/23He, Spin-0 4He) and express it in theGPD structure and the transverse images.
Evolution of TMD distributionsThe theoretical formulation of the transverse momen-tumdependenceofpartonshasmadesubstantialprogressin the last decade (see Sec. 10.4). Factorization andrenormalization predict a distinctive scale and rapid-ity dependence of the TMD distributions, generatedby gluon radiation with Sudakov suppression, and de-scribed by the CSS evolution equations. The EIC willallow one to test these predictions in measurements ofsemi-inclusive hadron productionγ∗ + N →h+ X,h =π,K,... ThewidekinematicrangeaccessiblewithEICisessentialforobservingthelogarithmicdependenciesim-plied by the evolution equation and separating pertur-bative and nonperturbative dynamics (see Fig.14.2.2).
The results will provide crucial insight into the theoryof CSS-type radiation and its applicability to DIS-typeprocesses.
Spin-orbit correlations in TMD distributionsAn interesting feature of the transverse momentum de-pendence of partons is that it is correlated with thenucleon and parton spin, giving rise to observable spin-orbit effects that provide insights into nucleon structureand color field dynamics (see Sec.10.4). At EIC theseeffects can be studied in measurements of hadron pro-duction (semi-inclusive DIS, jets) with polarized elec-tron and proton beams. Measurement of the Sivers andCollins asymmetries are possible with the transverseproton beam polarization readily available at collider(see Fig.14.2.7) [3105]. The results will provide exten-sive information on orbital angular momentum, finalstate interactions, and the quark transversity distribu-tions in nucleon.
14.2.3 Nuclear high-energy scattering in QCDHigh-energy scattering on nuclei (A > 1) provides awealth of information on the effective dynamics emerg-ing from QCD at various energy and distance scales.
Depending on the kinematic regime, such processes re-veal the QCD substructure of individual nucleon inter-actions (intermediate/large x) or coherent QCD phe-nomena involving the entire nucleus (smallx). The EICwill realize the first electron-nucleus collisions in collid-ing beam experiments, combining the kinematic reachofcollidingbeamswiththeprecisionandcontrolofelec-tromagnetic scattering, and thus transform this field ofstudy.
Nuclear quark/gluon densitiesThe nuclear PDFs describe the basic particle contentof the nucleus in QCD degrees of freedom [4467–4470].
Comparison with the PDFs of an ensemble of non-inter-acting nucleons provides insight into nucleon interac-tions and coherent phenomena. Many aspects of thenuclear PDFs are still poorly known, esp. the nucleargluons and the charge and flavor dependence of the nu-clear quarks at x ≲ 0.1. The EIC will determine thenuclear PDFs using inclusive DIS on a broad range ofnuclei [3105, 4471]. The nuclear gluon PDF will be de-termined indirectly through theQ2 dependence of thenuclearDIScrosssection(DGLAPevolution),usingthewide kinematic coverage available with the collider. Itwill also be determined directly through measurementsofheavyflavorproductioninnuclearDIS,takingadvan-tage of the high production rates and next-generationreconstruction capabilities provided by the EIC. Theresults will establish whether the nuclear gluons aresuppressed at x >0.3 like the valence quarks (EMCeffect), and whether they are enhanced atx∼0.1 (anti-shadowing)assuggestedbytheoreticalarguments;both14.2 The EIC program 509|t | (GeV2)0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18J/ψ|η(edecay)| < 4p(edecay) > 1 GeV/cδt/t = 5% ∫Ldt = 10/A fb -11 < Q2 < 10 GeV2, x < 0.0110410310210110-110-2coherent - no saturationincoherent - no saturationcoherent - saturation (bSat)incoherent - saturation (bSat)dσ(e Au → e' Au' J/ψ)/dt (nb/GeV2)Fig. 14.2.8 Differential cross section of coherent and incoher-ent J/ψ production on a Au nucleus, as a function of the mo-mentum transfert[3105, 4472, 4473].

phenomena reveal aspects of the QCD substructure ofnucleon interactions.
Shadowing and saturationIn high-energy scattering at x ≪ 0.1 the coherencelength of the process becomes larger than the size ofthe nucleus, and the high-energy probe interacts withall nucleons along its path. In this regime the gluons“seen” by the probe can no longer be attached to indi-vidual nucleons but represent a property of the wholenucleus, giving rise to striking new phenomena. Shad-owingisthereductionoftheleading-twistnucleargluondensity resulting from destructive interference of am-plitudes with gluons attached to different nucleons; seeRef. [4474] for a review. Saturation is the appearanceof a new dynamical scale in the form of the transversedensity of gluons per area. It emerges from nonlinearQCD evolution equations including gluon recombina-tion [4475–4480] and can be used as the basis of aneffective field theory description of strong interactionsat smallx– the Color Glass Condensate [3276], leadingto many interesting predictions; see Refs. [4481–4483]for reviews. Both phenomena are connected, as shadow-ing reduces the gluon density and modifies the expectedQ2sat ∼A1/3 scaling of the saturation scale. Exploringthese phenomena will be a prime task of the EIC.

dijet and dihadron production [3281, 4484, 4485]. Fur-ther insight can be gained from studies of diffractivescattering on nuclei. Measurements of coherent heavyvector meson production on nuclei probe the impactparameter dependence of the shadowing and/or satura-tion effects through the diffraction pattern in the mo-mentum transfer|t|(see Fig.14.2.8) [3105, 4472, 4473].
Similar studies can be performed in measurements ofcoherent inclusive diffraction on nuclei [4486]. The EICprovides the necessary energy for diffractive scattering,and the ability to identify coherent processes throughforward detection.
Nuclear breakup and spectator taggingIn high-energy scattering on light ions, detection of thenuclear breakup state provides information on the nu-clear configuration present during the high-energy pro-cess [4488]. In the case of the deuteron, detection ofthe “spectator” proton identifies events with scatteringon the neutron and fixes the relative momentum of theproton-neutronconfiguration.Thiscanbeusedtoselectscattering in large-size nuclear configurations, whereinteractions are absent and the neutron is free [4489,4490], or small-size configurations, where thepnsystemstronglyinteractsandthepartonicstructureismodified(short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations) [4491]. TheEIC will enable a program of high-energy scattering onthe deuteron with proton or neutron spectator tagging.

The setupcan be used to extract free neutron structure functions(see Fig.14.2.9) [4487], study the configuration depen-dence of EMC effect, or explore short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations in deuteron breakup in diffractivescattering [4492].
14.2.4 Emergence of hadrons from QCDUnderstandinghadronization–theemergenceofhadronsfrom the energetic quarks/gluons produced in deep-inelasticprocesses–remainsamajorchallengeofstronginteraction physics. The hadronization process is “re-ciprocal” to the partonic structure of hadrons but muchless understood theoretically, because it involves time-like momentum transfers and propagation over largedistances, and methods based on imaginary-time (Eu-clidean) quantum field theory such as Lattice QCD aregenerally not applicable (see Sec.4). Basic open ques-tions are the time/distance scales of parton fragmenta-tion and hadron formation; the role of non-perturbativedynamics (chiral symmetry breaking, vacuum fields; seeSec. 5.11), and the effects of the nuclear medium onthe hadronization process. In addition to the scientificinterest, these topics are of eminent practical impor-tance for the development of event generators describ-ing strong interaction dynamics in high-energy colli-sions (see Sec.11.4).
Fragmentation functionsBasic information on the hadronization process is sum-marized in the quark/gluon fragmentation functions,describing the probability for single-inclusive hadronproduction by an energetic color charge; see Ref. [4493]for a review. While much information on the fragmen-tation functions has been extracted from e+e− anni-hilation, pp collisions, and fixed-target semi-inclusiveDISexperiments,severalfeaturesremainpoorlyknown,such as the quark charge dependence (so-called unfa-vored vs. favored fragmentation), strangeness fragmen-tation and kaon production, and gluon fragmentation[3066,4494–4496].TheEICwilldeterminethefragmen-tation functions from semi-inclusive DIS inep and enscattering over a broad kinematic range [3105]. Thesemeasurementswillbeabletoseparatethequarkchargesin the initial state, extract the gluon through NLO ef-fects, and study theQ2 evolution of the fragmentationfunctions. The spin dependence of quark fragmentationwill be investigated through measurements ofΛ frag-mentation [4497]. Precise knowledge of the fragmenta-tion functions will in turn improve the extraction of theflavor dependence of the quark/antiquark spin PDFsfrom polarized semi-inclusive DIS data.

Dihadron correlationsMoredetailedinformationonthefragmentationprocesscomes from measurements of hadron correlations, de-scribed by the theoretical framework of dihadron frag-mentation functions [4498–4500]. The EIC will measuredihadron fragmentation functions in DIS and allow forthe new theoretical concepts to be applied and tested.
ThekinematiccoverageprovidedbytheEICwillensurethat the picture of independent fragmentation remainsapplicable even in multi-hadron measurements.
Jets and heavy flavorsAn alternative view of the hadronization process is ob-tained by applying the concepts of jet physics, whereone defines a system of collinear partons according toquantitativeobservablecriteriawithoutreferencetonon-perturbativefragmentationfunctions(seeSecs. 6.4,11.5and Sec. 12). These concepts and methods have beendevelopedfor pp/p¯pscatteringathadroncolliders(LHC,Tevatron) but can be extended toepscattering at EICat lower energies. This extension opens up several newdirections for studying the internal properties of jetsand using them as a probe of partonic structure. Inep collisions where the scattered electron is detected,it defines the jet energy and scale, and the conceptsfor leading jets can be applied to the DIS current jetwith known initial conditions, providing new possibili-ties to test the dynamics [4502–4504]. In addition, jetsubstructure can be investigated [4501]. Jets can also bestudied in ep collisions where the scattered electron isnotdetected,orin γpcollisions,wherethejettransversemomentum serves as the hard scale (see Fig.14.2.10 as14.2 The EIC program 511CHAPTER 7.

The observed R eA( z ) is qualitativelyconsistent with the effective modiﬁcation of fragmentation functions even aftertheir convolution with the PDFs and the perturbative hard part. There is a sig-niﬁcant suppression for large values of z , but it quickly evolves to enhancementfor z < 0.65 and z < 0.8 for D -mesons and B -mesons, respectively. The effect ismost pronounced at forward rapidities and one ﬁnds that RheAas a function of zis a more suitable observable for cold nuclear matter tomography at the EIC thanthe transverse momentum distributions’ modiﬁcation for hadrons in the labora-tory frame alone. At smaller center-of-mass energies differential particle spectrafall faster with p T, similar to what is observed in hadronic collisions [989], whichfurther enhances the observed nuclear effects. Production of particles that containstrange quarks, such as kaons, can also be studied at the EIC [990].
Heavy meson reconstruction and physics projectionsDue to the asymmetric nature of the collisions at the EIC, most of the ﬁnal statehadrons are produced in the nucleon/nucleus beam going (forward) direction. Asilicon vertex/tracking is critical to precisely measure these forward hadrons at theEIC. A LANL experimental team has produced conceptual designs of a ForwardSilicon Tracker (FST) coupled to tracking in the central region to enable jet andheavy ﬂavor physics at the EIC [845, 846, 991]. EIC Fun4all simulations were per-formed with both the Babar and BeAST magnets. A 95% detection hit efﬁciency isused in both track and vertex reconstructions. In track reconstruction, the KalmanFilter algorithm is used and a 20 µ m vertex Gaussian smearing is applied to both xand y directions. The full simulation results, including momentum resolution anddistance of closest approach resolution are applied to heavy meson reconstructionFig. 14.2.11Medium modification of theD0 production crosssection expected at EIC, as a function ofz, in different regionsof pseudoradpidityη [3105, 4508].
an example). Particularly interesting are jets inducedby heavy quarks, which remain stable under strong in-teractions and create distinct signals in the detector(D,B meson decays). The EIC will support this pro-gram through a comprehensive set of measurementsof leading jets, jet substructure, heavy flavor jets, andstudies of partonic structure and TMD distributions us-ing jets [3105]. This is a rapidly evolving field, wherenew theoretical methods will become available until theEIC experiments are performed.
Target fragmentationEqually interesting is the hadronization of the targetremnant in DIS processes (target fragmentation). Itcan be regarded as the materialization of a nucleonwith a “hole” in its color wave function (created by theremoved parton) and provides information on baryonnumber transport, multiparton correlations [4505], ha-ronization dynamics, and spin-orbit effects. A frame-work for QCD analysis of target fragmentation is pro-vided by the generalized factorization theorems [3951,4506]. The EIC will enable a comprehensive programof nucleon target fragmentation studies, using the de-tectors in forward pseudorapidity region [3105]. Spin ef-fectsintargetfragmentationcanbestudiedusingpolar-izedprotonbeamsand/orfragmentationinto Λbaryons[4507]. Important advantages of the collider comparedto fixed-target experiments are that there is no ma-terial surrounding the target, and that the fragmentsmove forward with a finite fraction of the proton beammomentum.
Hadronization in mediumThe hadronization studies described above can be ex-tended fromep to eA scattering, to investigate the in-fluence of the nuclear medium on the hadronizationprocess. The medium effects depend essentially on thefar−forward p/A/fragmentsfar−backward electronFig. 14.2.12 Schematic of the EIC detector concept.
energy of the fragmenting parton in the nuclear restframe Eh = zν. The wide range of scattering energiesavailable at EIC will allow one to move the fragmen-tation process “in” and “out” of the nucleus, enablingcontrolled and detailed studies of the medium effects.
This will make it possible to test various hadroniza-tion models and determine the time/distance scale pa-rameters. The study of nuclear final-state interactionswill also improve the modeling of nuclear breakup inDIS processes, which in turn will help with the analysisof coherent nuclear scattering and spectator tagging.
Particularly useful for the study of medium effects areheavy-quark probes (see Fig.14.2.11 for an example)[4508, 4509].
Hadron spectroscopyHadron production in high-energyep/eA scattering atEIC can also be used for spectroscopy, complement-ing experiments usingpp and e+e− scattering. Exoticheavy quarkonium states (XYZ states, see Secs. 8.5and 8.6) can be produced in exclusive photo/electro-production processesγ∗ + p→M+ N. The productionrates and reconstruction efficiency with the EIC detec-tor are presently under study [3105, 4510, 4511]. AtEIC, new possibilities arise from measurements of thespin density matrix elements of heavy vector states, tar-get polarization observables, and theQ2 dependence inelectroproduction. These unique capabilities of the EICcould be used as the focus shifts from spectroscopy toinvestigations of the structure of exotic states.

The physics require-ments and detector concept are described in detail inthe EIC Yellow Report [3105]. A schematic is shownin Fig. 14.2.12. The pseudorapidity region−1 ≲ η ≲1 is covered by the central “barrel” detector with asolenoidal magnetic field; the regions −4 ≲ η ≲ −1and 1 ≲ η≲ 4 are covered by the “lepton endcap” and“hadron endcap” detectors; the detectors provide capa-bilities for tracking and vertex detection, electromag-netic and hadronic calorimetry, and particle identifica-tion. These systems capture the scattered electron andthe final state produced by the struck parton in typicalDIS events. The far-backward region (outgoing electronbeam direction) is instrumented with a low-Q2 elec-trontaggerforphotoproduction.Thefar-forwardregion(outgoing proton/ion beam direction) is equipped withan elaborate detection system for charged and neutralbeam fragments, integrated in the interaction region,involving a magnetic dipole spectrometer with track-ing detector for charged particles and a zero-degreecalorimeter for neutral particles. This system providesessential capabilities for detecting far-forward protonsand neutrons in exclusive/diffractive processes on theproton, spectator nucleons or nuclear fragments in scat-tering on nuclei, and coherent nuclear recoil. It presentsa major challenge for design, integration, and engineer-ing, and is critical for large part of the physics program.
Further information on the EIC detector requirementsand conceptual design can be found in Ref. [3105]. Thetechnical design and formation of a detector collabora-tion are in progress. The addition of a second detectorwith complementary capabilities is planned as a futureupgrade.
The EIC User Group is an international affiliationof scientists promoting scientific, technological, and ed-ucational efforts in the development of the EIC facil-ity and science program. It presently has more than1200 members from more than 250 institutions (labo-ratories, universities) worldwide. Resources and infor-mation about activities and events can be found on thewebpages [4512].
14.3 J-PARC hadron physicsShunzo KumanoHadron physics is the field to understand our visibleuniverse,namelyhadronicmany-bodysystemsfromlowto high densities, from low to high temperatures, andfrom low to high energies, in terms of fundamental par-ticles of quarks and gluons and their interactions. Withthe significant developments of perturbative QCD dur-ing 50 years of QCD, asymptotic freedom and scalingviolation are now basically understood. On the otherhand, the nonperturbative region is still under investi-gations by phenomenological models and lattice QCD.
One may note that at present lattice QCD cannot beapplied to finite density systems, which makes it diffi-cult to predict precisely hadronic and nuclear phenom-ena at low energies.
Although QCD is known as the correct theory ofstrong interactions, there are unexpected experimentaldiscoveries of new hadronic and nuclear forms whichwere not predicted by theorists. Therefore, experimen-talprojectsareessentialforadeeperunderstandingandfor further developments of QCD beyond the 50-yearshistory. The Japan Proton Accelerator Research Com-plex (J-PARC) as one of the flagship facilities in hadronphysics should play a key role in hadron physics fromthe low to the medium-energy region, by supplying pre-cise experimental information on new forms of matters,as illustrated in Fig.14.3.1.
The J-PARC is located at Tokai in Japan. It is oper-ated by both the High Energy Accelerator Research Or-ganization(KEK)andtheJapanAtomicEnergyAgency(JAEA). J-PARC is responsible to coordinate the ef-forts of KEK and JAEA. KEK is in charge of nuclearand particle-physics projects by using the 30-GeV pro-ton accelerator. J-PARC is a multi-purpose facility toinvestigate a wide range of scientific topics from life sci-encestocondensed-matter,nuclear,andparticlephysics[4513].
The J-PARC accelerator consists of a 400-MeV linacasaninjector,a3-GeVrapid-cyclingsynchrotron(RCS),and the 30GeV main-ring synchrotron. The RCS accel-erates the protons up to 3GeV as shown in Fig.14.3.2.
Its beam pulses are delivered mostly to the materialsand life-science experimental facility, and a small por-tion is injected to the main ring. The protons are ac-celerated to 30GeV in the main ring, and they are de-TµBQ2J-PARC Neutron star Fig.14.3.1 QCDphasediagramandJ-PARChadronprojects.14.3 J-PARC hadron physics 513Fig. 14.3.2 Aerial view of J-PARC [4513].
livered to the neutrino experimental facility and thehadron experimental facility. The beam reached an en-ergy of 30GeV in 2008, its power was increased towardsthe design intensity of 0.75 MW. In the near future, weexpect to have about 1 MW for the neutrino facilityand about 100 kW for the hadron one [4513].
The J-PARC is the most intense accelerator abovethe multi-GeV energy region. Its aim is to investigate awide range of nuclear and particle physics by using sec-ondary beams of kaons, pions, antiprotons, neutrinos,andmuonsaswellastheprimaryprotonbeamasshownin Fig.14.3.3. There are particle physicsexperiments onneutrino oscillations, lepton-flavor violation,g−2, rarekaon decays, and the neutron electric-dipole moment tosearch for physics beyond the Standard Model. Sincethe purpose of this report is to discuss QCD-relatedtopics, only the hadron-physics projects are explained.
14.3.1 J-P ARC hadron facilityThe layout of the J-PARC hadron facility is shown inFig. 14.3.4 with the hall size of 60m width and 56mlength. Nuclear and particle physics experiments areFig. 14.3.3 Secondary beams at J-PARC [4513].

done by using the primary proton beam and secondarybeams of pions, kaons, antiprotons, and muons. Uniquepoints of this proton accelerator facility are (1) highintensity and (2) intermediate energy. The first pointindicates the decisive advantage when secondary beamsor the primary proton beam are used for precision ex-periments. Intermediate energies are important sincelow-energy hadron projects can bridge the transitionregion from hadrons to quarks and gluons by variationof the momentum transfer in the QCD phase diagram,as illustrated in Fig.14.3.1. The facility should be ableto contribute to the development of QCD from the non-perturbative region to the transition region, then to theperturbative one.
Particle-physics experiments in the hadron hall arelepton-flavor violation (COMET) and rare kaon decays(KL). The COMET experiment uses muons from thedecays of pions produced by 8GeV proton collisions ona production target. COMET will search for the lepton-flavor violation process, the conversion of muons intoelectrons in the field of a nucleus,µ−+A→e−+A. TheKOTO experiment uses the neutral-kaon beamline KLfor measuring the frequency of the CP-violating decayK0L →π0ν¯ν. These projects are intended to find a sig-nature beyond the Standard Model in particle physics.
Hadron-physics experiments are done at the beam-lines K1.8, K1.8BR, K1.1, and High p, see Fig.14.3.4[4514]. The K1.1 beamline is yet to be constructed. TheK1.8 beamline supplies kaons with the momentum ofabout 1.8GeV and is used to study hypernuclei, e.g.Ξhypernuclei,by (K−,K+) reactions.Onemaynotethatthe cross section ofp(K−,K+)Ξ reaches a maximumat a momentum of 1.8GeV. The K1.8BR is a branchline of K1.8 to supply kaons with low momenta of 0.7-1.1GeV. The cross section of the quasi-elastic reactionK−N → ¯KN maximizes at 1GeV momentum, so that514 14 THE FUTUREthis beamline is intended to study¯KN interactions andkaonic nuclei by(K−,N) reactions with light nuclei.
The K1.1 beamline supplies kaons with momentumaround 1.1GeV for measurements ofΛhypernuclei. Be-cause of the space interference between the K1.1 andhigh-p beamlines, K1.1 experiments will be done afterthe first stage of the high-p experiment. These strangenuclear physics projects are explained in Sec.14.3.3.
Thehigh-momentumbeamlineprovides30GeVpro-tons and unseparated hadrons up to 20GeV. The beamof unseparated hadrons, to be prepared in the near fu-ture, consists mainly of pions. The first experiment inthis beamline will measure hadron mass modificationsin a nuclear medium to study chiral-symmetry breakingand hadron-mass generation (see Sec.14.3.4).
Then, charmed baryon spectroscopy will be inves-tigated by (π−,D∗−) reactions. This experiment in-tends to find di-quark degrees of freedom, which arenot easily found in hadrons consisting of light quarksonly, as explained below in Sec.14.3.5. The hadron to-mography project will be performed together with thisspectroscopy experiment by studying generalized par-ton distributions (GPDs) as discussed in Sec.14.3.6.
This experiment is set up to find the origin of hadronmasses and spins by the tomography technique. In fu-ture, separated hadron beams could become possible;an extension plan of this hadron hall is discussed in thenext subsection14.3.2.
More details of each hadron project are explained inthe following sections. The first major experiment willstudy the role of strangeness in nuclear physics. Thenext experiment is devoted to hadron mass modifica-tions in the nuclear medium, and then the charmed-baryon project will start. The GPD tomography ex-periment is expected to join this baryon-spectroscopyproject. The scope of the hadron physics projects atJ-PARC is thus expanding in the near future.
Furthermore, there is a significant interest to builda new heavy-ion facility at J-PARC to investigate thephase diagram in the low-temparature and high-densityregion in contrast to the kinematical region of RHICand LHC. There are interesting topics in cold and densematters, such as the end point of the phase transitionand color superconductor, as explained in Sec.14.3.7.
When the hadron program will be completed, theheavy-ion facility will be built. This is expected in the2030’s. J-PARC will then become a leading hadron ac-celerator facility. It will investigate QCD in a wide kine-matical region and for a wide range of topics, fromstrangeness in nuclear physics, charmed-baryon spec-troscopy, nucleon structure at intermediate energies,and quark-hadron matter.
14.3.2 Hadron-hall extensionThe current hadron hall cannot accommodate enoughprojectsinnuclearandparticlephysics.Theexperimen-tal hall size and beamlines are much smaller than, forexample, the BNL-AGS facility. The efficient way forutilizing the full ability of the J-PARC is to expand itsspace and to build additional beamlines.

This extension project, as shown in Fig.14.3.5, wasproposedtogetherwiththecurrenthall[ 4515].Theareaof the hall becomes twice larger to accommodate newexperiments. A new production target T2 will be pre-pared. The beamlines with orange color are new ones inthe extended hall. They are designed for the followingtopics.

HIHRThis HIHR (High Intensity High Resolution) beam-line is intended for precision spectroscopy ofΛ hy-pernuclei through(π±,K+) reactions by using high-intensity and high-resolution charged pions up to2GeV momentum with an excellent momentum res-olution of 10−4 and a missing-mass resolution of afew hundred keV.

This extension project was selected as one of toppriority projects of KEK in 2022. After the financial ap-proval, it will take 6 years for its construction. When itis realized, it will provide excellent opportunities for nu-clear and particle physicists to create innovative fieldswithunprecedentedprecision.Thefollowingmajorphysicspurposesarepresentlyconsideredforthisextensionproject:(1) precise spectroscopy of hypernuclei to understandneutron stars, (2) novel aspects of charmed baryons,and (3) New Physics beyond the Standard Model. Thedetailsofthetopics(1)and(2)arediscussedinSec. 14.3.3and Sec.14.3.5, respectively, along with past J-PARCexperiments on hypernuclei.
BecausetheJ-PARCisanintermediate-energyfacil-ity, the current scope of physics could be extended in fu-ture, for example, by including projects of high-energyQCD such as on nucleon structure, exotic hadrons bythe constituent counting rule, and color transparency[4516]. Furthermore, if the heavy-ion accelerator willbe built [4517], the unexplored cold and dense region ofthe QCD phase diagram will be investigated.
Here, we briefly summarize the major purposes re-lated to the hadron-hall extension including possiblefuture topics.
Establishing the role of strangeness in nuclear physicsThe nuclear physics without strangeness has been es-tablished by precise information on the fundamentalNN potentials from abundant experimental measure-mentson NN scatteringsanddeuteronproperties,where-as theYN scattering information is in a poor situation.
The J-PARC will supply precise data on the fundamen-tal YN interactions and also properties of hypernuclei.
We expect that spectroscopy of hypernuclei could be-come a precision field by the J-PARC experiments.
Applications to neutron starsThe existence of strangeness inside neutron stars wouldmake their equations of state much softer. This is inconflict with astrophysical observations of neutron-starmasses. By establishing strangeness nuclear physics, weexpect that this issue will be solved.
Creation of a di-fermion field in hadron physicsThe di-fermion physics has been investigated in quan-tum many-body systems, especially condensed-matterphysics. In hadron physics, the color superconductor,for example, is investigated in such a context. The J-PARC intends to create a new di-fermion field by thespectroscopy of the charmed baryons.
Emergence of hadron masses and spinsHadronmassesandspinsarefundamentalphysicsquan-tities to constitute our visible universe. However, theirorigins are not understood easily from quark and gluondegrees of freedom. They should originate as emergentphenomena of nontrivial quark-gluon dynamics withinhadrons.TheseshouldbeclarifiedbytheJ-PARCprojectson hadron-mass modifications in nuclear medium andby hadron tomography via GPDs.
Understanding cold and dense QCD mattersFrom the RHIC and LHC, the high-temparature regionof the QCD phase diagram has been investigated andevidence for quark-gluon-plasma formation was found.
J-PARC will clarify the cold and dense region, whereinteresting phase properties, such as the end point ofthe phase transition and color superconductor, are the-oretically expected.
14.3.3 Strangeness nuclear physicsMajor properties of stable nuclei are now relatively wellunderstood, whereas unstable nuclei are still under in-vestigations especially in connection with the nucle-osynthesis in astrophysics. One of the major purposesof the J-PARC hadron program is to investigate nucleiby including new flavor degrees of freedom, strangenessand charm [4514, 4515].
Under the flavor SU(3) symmetry, nucleons and apart of hyperons constitute a flavor octet. Two-baryoninteractions are decomposed into symmetric (under theexchange of baryons) states27 ⊕8 ⊕1 and antisym-metric ones10 ⊕10∗ ⊕8 as8 ⊗8 = 27S ⊕10A ⊕10∗A ⊕8S ⊕8A ⊕1S. (14.3.1)Nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions provide informa-tion only on the 27S and 10∗A states. Therefore, hy-peron interactions need to be investigated to under-stand the other terms and to find possible new hadronicmany-body systems. These new interactions are rele-vant in neutron stars. This nuclear-physics project withstrangeness has the following advantages [4518].
1. SU(3) flavor symmetry and new interactionsThe new interaction terms10A, 8S, 8A, and1S canbe investigated by the hyperon (Y) interactions. Ingeneral, YN interactions are expected to be weakerthan the NN ones, so that new forms of baryonicmany-body systems should be created.
2. Probe of short-range interactionsSince the pion isospin is 1 and theΛisospin is 0, theπΛΛ coupling constant vanishes. Because of its lowmass, the pion contributes to the long-range part of516 14 THE FUTURE1 MeV 10 MeV 100 MeV 1 GeV 10 GeV 100 GeV 1 TeV su d c b tms ΛQCD Chiral symmetry (m << ΛQCD )Non-relativistic quark model (m >> ΛQCD )ms≈ ΛQCD Fig. 14.3.6 Strangeness as a probe of QCD dynamics.
the baryon interactions. Without the pion contribu-tion, medium- and short-range baryon interactionsshould become more apparent when compared tothe NN case.
3. Probe of QCD dynamicsThe quark masses and the QCD scale parameterΛare shown in Fig.14.3.6. We notice that the strange-quark mass is of the order of the scale parameter.
This fact suggests an advantage that the strangequark could be a good probe of QCD dynamics.
However, it may also indicate difficulties for describ-ing hadrons with strangeness.
4. New forms of hadronic mattersOrdinarynucleiconsistmainlyofupanddownquarks.
The interactions of hyperons or cascade particleswithnucleonsarestillunexplored.Withstrangeness,newformsofnucleishouldbecreatedsuchas ¯KNN,and so on. Another important topic is the possibleexistence of a H dibaryon with isospin 0, spin 0,and strangeness−2. It corresponds to the term1Sin Eq.(14.3.1).
5. Probe of deep regions in nucleiThe Pauli exclusion plays an important role in nu-clearphysics.Althoughnucleiarestrongly-interactingsystems with nucleons close together, they are oftendescribed by a non-interacting Fermi gas model oranindependentparticlemodel.Itisjustifiedbysolv-ing the Bethe-Goldstone equation. Hyperons do notsuffer from such an exclusion effect, which indicatesthe advantage of probing deep regions of nuclei, asthe shell structure should become obvious as visu-alized in Fig.14.3.7 [4515, 4519].
6. Equation of state for neutron starsNeutron-star physics has significantly developed re-cently due to new astrophysical experiments and ob-servations of gravitational waves. In the inner high-density region of the neutron stars, the reactionsp+ e− →Λ+ νe and n+ e− →Σ− + νe could occurbecause the changes of the Fermi energies of neu-trons, protons, and electrons exceed the mass gapof the reactions. The equation of state of neutronstars should be significantly softened by the pos-sible existence of hyperons, which contradicts theneutron-star observations. The appearance of hy-perons in the neutron stars is affected by the detailsof hyperon interactions, which are investigated atJ-PARC.
We introduce some of the major experimental re-sults on strangeness in nuclear physics from J-PARC.
Charge symmetry breakingCharge symmetry is taken as granted as a good sym-metry for ordinary nuclei as typically shown in mir-ror nuclei with exchange of a proton and a neutron.
For example, the binding energy difference between3Heand 3H is merely 0.07MeV after removing QED effects.
However, a significant breaking was found by the E13experiment at J-PARC. The1+ excited state of 4ΛHewas produced in the 4He(K−,π−)4ΛHe reaction witha 1.5GeV K− beam. Then, by a measurement of theγ rays for the1+ →0+ transition, a 1.406 ±0.002 ±0.002 MeV energy spacing was found. With other mea-surements, the spectra of 4ΛHe and 4ΛH are comparedin Fig.14.3.8 [4520]. The binding energy difference be-tween 4ΛHe and4ΛH was0.35±0.05 MeV, which indicatesa significant charge-symmetry breaking in hypernuclei.
It provided a valuable information on the nature ofΛN interactions which are different from the NN ones.
Theoretically, the breaking is considered to come fromΛ−Σ0 mixing.
Double Λ hypernucleiOne of the major purposes of J-PARC program on hy-pernuclei is to investigate strangeness−2 systems. TheJ-PARC-E07 experiment was done at the K1.8 beam-line with the K− beam of 1.8GeV. By using nuclearemulsionstaggedbythe (K−,K+) reaction,thedouble- Λhypernucleus ΛΛBe was found [4521]. It is producedas 10ΛΛBe by Ξ−+16O → 10ΛΛBe +4He+t,as 11ΛΛBe by Ξ−+16O → 11ΛΛBe+4He+d, oras 12ΛΛBe∗ by Ξ−+16O → 12ΛΛBe∗+4He+p,Fig. 14.3.7 Simulation for the Λ binding energy spectra of208Λ Pb for the hadron-extension program [4519]14.3 J-PARC hadron physics 5171/2 +1+1.090.020+1/2 +1 406.

Thisresultimprovesourunderstandingofthe ΛΛinteractionand double-strange hypernulcei.
Ξ hypernucleiThe J-PARC-E07 collaboration used the 1.81GeVK−beam for observing the reactionΞ−+14N→10ΛBe +5ΛHe.
From the measurements, theΞ− binding energy in theΞ−-14Nsystemwasdeterminedto1.27 ±0.21MeV[ 4522].
From the experimental data and theoretical calcula-tions, the energy level of theΞ− is interpreted as 1pstate; theΞN-ΛΛ coupling must be weak.
Next, Ξ− capture was studied in theΞ−-14N sys-tem. Two events were found by analyzing KEK-E373and J-PARC-E07 data signaling deepΞ− bound states[4523]. One event from the reactionΞ− +14 N →5Λ He + 5Λ He +4 He + nyields a binding energy in the14N nucleus ofBΞ− =6.27 ±0.27 MeV. The other event inΞ− +14 N →9Λ Be + 5Λ He + nyields BΞ− given by either8.00 ±0.77 MeV or4.96 ±0.77 MeV,dependingonthefinal-state 9ΛBenucleuswhichcan be in the ground or an excited state. These bindingenergies are larger than the preceding value 1.27MeV;likely, these events come from the 1s state of the Ξhypernucleus 15ΞC.
Kaonic nucleiKaonic nuclei are new forms of hadronic many-bodysystems with strangeness. Since Λ(1405) can be con-sidered as a ¯KN molecule state, a few nucleon sys-tems with a kaon should exist as bound states. TheJ-PARC-E15 collaboration used the K1.8BR beamlinefor measuring the reactionK−+3He →Λ+ p+ nwitha kaon momentum of 1GeV.

It indicates akaonic ¯KNN nucleus with a binding energy BK =42 ±3(stat.)+3−4(syst.)MeV and the decay widthΓK =100 ±7(stat.)+10−9 (syst.)MeV [4524]. The current situ-ation is shown in Fig.14.3.9 for energies and widthsof possibleK−ppbound states. The experimental dataare shown with the collaboration names, and the otherpoints are theoretical calculations. As it is obvious, theworld data do not agree with each other and they arealso different from the theoretical results, so that fur-ther J-PARC experiments are needed for clarifying thesituation.
The J-PARC-E62 collaboration used theK− beamwith900MeVmomentumattheK1.8BRbeamline.Thenegative kaons were stopped in a liquid-helium target[4525]. They obtained the energies and widths of the3d→2ptransition X-rays of kaonic3He and4He atomswith 10 times higher accuracy than previous data. Onthe other hand, using theK− beam with the momen-tum 1.8GeV at the K1.8 beamline, the J-PARC-E05collaboration measured the missing-mass spectrum of12C(K−,p)andobservedaquasi-elasticpeakfrom K−p→K−p[4526]. Then, they extracted differential cross sec-tions of theK−pelastic scattering. These experimentalmeasurements impose a constraint on theoretical mod-els of kaonic nuclei.
Σ±p scattering cross sectionsGood data were not available for hyperon-nucleonand hyperon-hyperon scattering. So far, these inter-actions had been investigated mainly within hypernu-clear models. This approach makes it difficult to es-tablish hypernuclear physics as a precision field on thesame level as theNN-interaction and ordinary nuclear518 14 THE FUTUREphysics. Furthermore, hyperon interactions are also es-sential for applications to neutron stars. Now, the sit-uation is changing due to new results onΣp scatteringdata from J-PARC.
First, Σ−pelastic scattering data were reported fora Σ− momentum range from 470 to 850MeV by the J-PARC-E40collaboration [4527]. Aπ− beamin theK.18beamline with a momentum of 1.33GeV impinged onliquid hydrogen target, whereΣ− particles were pro-duced in the reactionπ−p→K+Σ−. 4500 events wereidentified and differential cross sections forΣ−pelasticscattering were determined. Second, this collaborationreported differential cross sections of Σ−p → Λn inthe Σ− momentum range from 470 to 650MeV [4528].
About 100 events were identified and angular distribu-tions were obtained for the first time. Third, differentialcross sections were measured for theΣ+p elastic scat-tering in the momentum range from 0.44 to 0.80GeV[4529]. Theπ+ beam with the momentum 1.41GeV wasused to produce Σ+ in the reaction π+p →K+Σ+ .
About 2400 Σ+p elastic scattering events were identi-fied, and the 3S1 and 1P1 phase shifts were obtainedfrom the precise data for the first time.
These data are valuable for building the full baryon-baryoninteractionsoftheSU(3)multiplets,seeEq.( 14.3.1).
Withsuchexperimentalinformation,theNijmegen-typebaryon models should become much accurate and leadtoabetterunderstandingofhadronicandnuclearmany-body systems and neutron stars.
14.3.4 Hadrons in nuclear mediumHadron masses in nuclear medium will be measuredby using the primary protons of 30GeV at the high-momentum beamline as the J-PARC-E16 experiment[4530]. This project is intended to investigate the roleof chiral symmetry in hadron properties. The study isthus related to a clarification of the origin of hadronmasses. The discovery of the Higgs particle clarifiedthe origin of the masses of quarks and leptons. How-ever, this does not imply that masses of our nature, forexample, the nucleon mass, are understood. The “god”particle cannot create the hadron masses.
Since the nucleon mass is defined by the matrix ele-mentof∫d3xT00(x),where Tµν istheenergy-momentumtensor, it is decomposed into four terms [4531]:M = quark energy+ gluon energy+ quark mass+ trace anomaly. (14.3.2)Current masses of up- and down-quarks are very small,so their simple summation is much smaller than the nu-cleon mass. To understand the origin of hadron masses,it is necessary to clarify the complicated emergence ofmass from confined quarks and gluons. The clarificationof this mass emergence is one of top priority projectsfor building electron-ion colliders for physics in 2030’s[4532, 4533]. In the mass decomposition of Eq.(14.3.2),the trace anomaly term and the gluon condensate couldplay an important role in hadron masses. These will beinvestigated by theJ/ψ production process at charged-lepton accelerator facilities, such as the JLab, CERN-AMBER, and EICs. On the other hand, this topic hasalready been investigated by spacelike GPDs at JLaband CERN-COMPASS and also by timelike GPDs atKEKB. In fact, gravitational form factors of a hadronwere already extracted from actual experimental data[4534]. This E16 experiment is intimately related tothese world projects.
Theoriginalideaforgeneratingthehadronmassesisto use chiral-symmetry breaking. It gives rise to a non-vanishing ⟨¯qq⟩condensate [4535, 4536], which is calledscalar quark condensate. It plays a role of an order pa-rameter for the chiral phase transition. It cannot bedirectly measured in experiments, so that we have torely on actual observables. One of such quantities arevector-meson masses in a nuclear medium, they will bemeasured by the E16 experiment. There are theoreti-cal estimates on their mass modifications from the par-tial restoration of chiral symmetry inside the nuclearmedium [4535, 4536].
As for the experimental side, there were alreadymeasurements on the masses of vector mesons. For ex-ample, the KES-PS with the primary 12-GeV protonbeam provided data on the processesp+ A →V + X(V = ρ, ω, φ →e+e−) [4537, 4538]. They indicated9% mass shifts forω (ρ) and 3% forφ-mesons, respec-tively. From a comparison of theoretical models withthe mass-modification data, one can find that the quarkcondensate provides an important clue for mass gener-ation.
Precise measurements are expected for these massmodificationsfromtheE16experimentatJ-PARC.Thefirst physics run will be taken with C and Cu targetswith limited detector acceptance, and then more mea-surements will be done with the H and Pb targets andfull detector acceptance. The expected outcome for theφmeson spectrum from the reactionp+A→φ+X forthe first run with a copper target and 30GeV protonswas simulated using GEANT4, see Fig.14.3.10 [4539].
The momentum distribution of theφmeson was evalu-ated by using the code JAM (Jet AA Microscopic trans-port model) [4540], and the mass-modification parame-ter deduced by KEK-E325 [4538] was used. The figureis shown for slowly movingφ mesons (βγ <1.25), themass resolution is expected as 5.8MeV. In this slow-φcase, nuclear medium effects are large and the spec-14.3 J-PARC hadron physics 519Fig. 14.3.10Expected φme-son spectrum with the coppertarget by the J-PARC-E16 ex-periment [4539].
Fig. 14.3.11 Expected φ-mass data by the J-PARC-E16 and the KEK-E325 one[4539].
trum is modified significantly as shown in Fig.14.3.10.
The difference between the simulated data and the redspectrum should come from nuclear medium effects. Asthe φ velocity becomes larger, the spectrum modifica-tion becomes smaller. From these simulated data, themass ofφ-meson at rest in a nuclear medium can be de-duced. In Fig.14.3.11, the mass is extracted by usinga theoretical dispersion relation. The KEK-E325 datais shown for comparison. The KEK data was taken atonly one point and the errors are large. We notice thatthe J-PARC data are much more accurate even at thefirst stage and that four data points will enable us toextrapolate the momentumdependence for determiningthe φ mass at zero momentum.
To relate the actual experimental data of E16 to thequark condensate, it is important to understand hadroninteractions in nuclear medium because the φ mesonis produced with the momentum 1–2.5 GeV/c and itdecays intoe+e− outside or inside of the nucleus. Suchan effort to describe the momentum dependence is inprogress by transport simulations by using the Hadron-String Dynamics model [4541], whereφ-meson spectralfunction and their density dependence can be specified.
Therefore, new J-PARC data should provide a clue inunderstanding the role of chiral symmetry breaking forthe hadron masses.
14.3.5 Hadron spectroscopyHadron spectroscopy entered into the new era in thelast decade in the sense that there have been manyreports on exotic hadron candidates. Exotic hadronswere expected already when the quark model was pro-posed in 1964. The status of exotic mesons with quan-tum numbers not accessible within the quark model isreported in Section 8.3. In heavy-quark spectroscopy, alarge number of states, both mesons (see Sections 8.5,8.6) and baryons (see Section 9.4) have been found withFig. 14.3.12 Expected excitations ofN∗(qqq) and Y∗c (qqQ)[4542].
unusual properties. However, it is often not easy todistinguish so-called cryptoexotic hadrons, i.e. hadronswithquantumnumberscompatiblewithregularhadrons,fromordinaryonesbecausetheymayhavesimilarmasses.
Examplesare f0(980),a0(980) andΛ(1405) inthe1GeVmass region. It took rather a long time to accumulatesignatures from various observables for their tetra- orpenta-quark-like (or hadron molecular) nature .
In these days, exotic-hadron studies tend to focus onthe heavy-quark sector due to KEKB and LHCb discov-eries on exotic hadron candidates with charm and bot-tom quarks (see Section 9.4). Since charmed baryonswill be copiously produced at J-PARC, it is a goodopportunity to investigate details of charmed baryonspectroscopy including exotic candidates. At J-PARC,charmed baryons consist of two light quarks and oneheavy quark. These will be investigated by the E50 col-laboration.Duetotheexistenceofaheavyquarkwithina baryon, there are specific interactions and internalconfigurations, which do not exist in baryons with onlylight quarks. In the extended hadron hall,Ξ and Ω ex-citation spectra will be also investigated. Physics moti-vations of this project include the following.
1. Di-quark correlations in hadronsThe color magnetic interaction between quarks withindices i and j is given byVmag ∼αs(λi ·λj)(⃗ σi ·⃗ σj)/(mimj) where λ is the color SU(3) Gell-Mannmatrix, ⃗ σis the Pauli spin matrix, and m is thequark mass. Because it is proportional to1/(mimj),the interaction becomes weak for a heavy quark. Letus denote q and Q for light and heavy quarks, re-spectively. For aqqQ-type baryon, the qq interac-tion should be much stronger than theqQ one. Itmeans that a strong qq diquark correlation couldappear in such a baryon. Its expected spectrum forqqQ-type baryon in comparison with theqqq-typebaryon is shown in Fig.14.3.12 [4542], whereρandλ are the Jacobi coordinates. The ρ is defined ascoordinate between the two quarksqq, and the λ520 14 THE FUTUREFig. 14.3.13 Schematic picture ofπ−p→ D∗−Λ∗+c [4542].
is between qq and Q. The spectrum splits intoρ-and λ-mode excitations, called isotope shift. Theρmode corresponds to a rotation of the diquarkqq,and theλmode to an orbital excitation betweenqqand Q. These levels are further split by spin-spin in-teractions. These studies will lead to new dynamicalaspects in hadron physics and, more in general, todi-fermion physics in quantum-many-body systems.
2. Ξ and Ω baryon spectra and their propertiesThe details of the Ξ and Ω spectroscopy will beinvestigated. In addition, theΩ electric quadrupolemomentishighlyinteresting.Observationsofquadrupolemoments provide us information on the nature of in-teractions among constituents and on system defor-mations. A finite quadrupole moment suggests thata non-central force should exist. Indeed, the tensorforce in the one-gluon-exchange potential leads tothe expectation that hadrons should be deformed.
The Ω quadruple moment could be measured at J-PARC due to its “stable” nature. The quadrupolemoment has never been measured for any hadronsincluding ∆ [4543], it is an ambitious project.
The charmed-baryon-spectroscopy experiment willstart in the hadron hall at the high-momentum beam-line by using a beam of unseparated hadrons, essen-tially pions, with momenta up to 20GeV . The reac-tion π− + p → D∗− + Λ∗+c is used, as illustrated inFig. 14.3.13, for measuring the Λ∗+c spectrum by thep(π−,D∗−) missing mass. The simulation is shown forthe Λ∗+c spectrum in Fig. 14.3.14 by considering thepion momentum of 20GeV and 100-day beam time. Anew field of di-quark physics should be developed bythis project.
14.3.6 Hadron structure functionsThe J-PARC proton-beam energy of 30GeV covers theintermediate region from hadron degrees of freedom(d.o.f.) to quark d.o.f. described by perturbative QCD.
Inadditiontohypernuclearandcharmed-baryonphysicsat low energies, the higher-energy region should there-fore also be investigated, as illustrated in Fig.14.3.1.
The situation is similar to JLab projects, and J-PARCFig. 14.3.14 Simulation for the Λ∗+c spectrum by the K10beamline experiment at the extended hadron hall [4515].

is complimentary to JLab in the sense that differentobservables are available in hadron reactions.
The first experiment on hadron structure functionswill be on the GPDs for the proton [4544]. A proposal isbeing prepared [4516] to study exclusive Drell-Yan pro-cesses. The GPDs are observables to probe the three-dimensional structure, namely the transverse structure,in addition to the longitudinal parton distribution func-tions,andthenucleonspinandmasscompositions.Thisproject should be able to contribute to the clarificationof the hadron spin and mass in terms of quarks andgluons.
At the J-PARC high-momentum beamline, the ex-clusive Drell-Yan processπ−p→µ+µ−B is consideredas shown in Fig.14.3.15. The “pion” beam momentumis up to about 20GeV. If the baryonBis a neutron, thenucleonic GPDs will be measured, and transition GPDswill be investigated ifB is different from the neutron.
This process is complementary to the pion-productionexperiment γ∗ + p→π+ N at JLab with spacelike vir-tual photon, whereas the J-PARC process is with thetimelike one.
At the high-momentum beamline, there is an ap-provedexperimentE50forinvestigatingcharmedbaryons[4545].

The dimuons could comefrom various sources; however, the exclusive Drell-Yanprocess should be identified by the missing-mass (MX)spectra as shown in Fig.14.3.16. Here, the Monte-Carlosimulationisgivenforthepionmomentum pπ = 15 GeV.
The exclusive peak is obvious just below 1GeV, and itshould be separated from other processes like inclusiveDrell-Yan, J/ψ production, or random backgrounds.
In this experiment, the GPDs will be measured for0.1 < x <0.3 and timelike photons in contrast to theJLab experiment on the pion production for largerxand spacelike photons.
In future, there are further possibilities to extendthis project on GPD-related studies and, more gener-ally, on high-energy hadron physics [4546–4548]. We ex-plain some examples.
1. Pion-nucleon transition distribution amplitudesBybackwardcharmoniumproductioninpion-nucleoncollisions,pion-to-nucleontransition-distributionam-plitudes can be investigated.
2. GPDs in the ERBL regionThe primary proton beam can be used to measureGPDs by using the2 →3 process p+p→p+π+B.
If the final pion and proton have nearly oppositeand large transverse momenta with a large invariantenergy, the cross section is sensitive to the GPDs inthe special kinematical region of ERBL (Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage).
3. Exotic hadrons by constituent counting ruleThe determination of exotic hadrons is not easy inlow-energy global observables, and a much clearerdeterminationcouldbedonebyusingtheconstituentcounting rule in perturbative QCD. Actually, thestructure of the exotic-hadron candidate Λ(1405)could be determined by the exclusive processπ− +p→K0 + Λ(1405) at J-PARC.
4. Color transparencyThecolortransparencyindicatesthatahadronpassesfreely through the nuclear medium at large momen-tum transfer. It is a unique feature of QCD. Therewas a mysterious BNL-EVA measurement that thetransparency drops at a proton momentum p >10 GeV. The J-PARC should be able to clarify thisissue.
Infuture,weexpectthataseparatedhigh-momentumkaon beam will become available as the hadron-hall ex-tension program in addition to the protons and pions,so that a variety of these type experiments should be-come possible.
14.3.7 Heavy-ion physicsThe purpose of the J-PARC hadron physics is to con-tribute to our understanding of quantum many-bodysystems in a wide kinematical range of the phase di-agram by precision measurements of new observablesas explained in the beginning of this Section. Presently,the physics of dense QCD matters is an important miss-ing program in the current J-PARC experiments.
Dense hadronic systems have been investigated byheavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC in the high-temperatureandlow-densityregionasshowninFig. 14.3.17[4517,4549].Thecreationofaquark-gluonplasma(QGP)was established in the RHIC project by observablessuch as the collective flow of hadrons and medium mod-ifications of jets. It was surprising to find a small viscos-ity for the QGP, which initiated interdisciplinary stud-ies with the string theory through the AdS/CFT cor-respondence (see Section5.5). Higher-energy collisionsare now under investigations at LHC. In addition, thesignature of the color-glass condensate has been inves-tigated at these facilities.
At zero baryon density, lattice QCD suggests thatthe phase transition is a crossover, whereas theoreti-cal models indicate that at high densities the phasetransition should be a first-order transition [4550]. Thisimplies that an endpoint of the first-order transitionshould exist as shown in Fig.14.3.17. There are also in-teresting topics on color superconductivity in the coldand dense matter region. After the QGP discovery andstudiesofitsproperties,thefrontierofheavy-ionphysicsshould be this unexplored region. In fact, there areprojects at FAIR and NICA to investigate this regionin the near future.
In order to realize such experiments at J-PARC, anadditional facility is needed to accelerate heavy ions.522 14 THE FUTUREFig. 14.3.17 QCD phase diagram with heavy-ion facilities[4517]The possibility of the heavy-ion experiment was stud-ied in a letter of intent in 2016 [4551]; the proposal wassubmitted to the J-PARC PAC in 2021 [4517, 4552].
For this project, it is necessary to construct a new linacand a new booster synchrotron. With this injector con-sists of the linac and the synchrotron together withthe rapid-cycling and the main-ring synchrotrons (seeFig. 14.3.2), high-intensity heavy-ion beams with 2-12AGeV will be obtained. The energies of the heavy-ionfacilities for the cold and dense experiments are shownin Fig. 14.3.18 The J-PARC-HI (heavy ion) project isa unique position as the highest-intensity facility in theseveralGeV region.

The advantage of the di-electron measurement is thatthe virtual photon does not suffer from strong final-state interactions in the medium, so that it directlyreflects the information on the QCD matter.

Two simulation studies are shown in Fig.14.3.19for the di-electron spectrum [4517].

In the right-hand side, 10% accu-racy is possible ifMee >0.7 GeV data are selected. Thisambitious J-PARC project makes it possible to find newphenomena of cold and dense matter.
14.4 The NICA programAlexey GuskovThe Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) isa new research complex for studying the fundamentalproperties of the strong interaction under developmentas a flagship project at the Joint Institute for NuclearResearch [4555–4557]. The heart of NICA is the Nu-clotron – a superconducting ion synchrotron put in op-eration in 1993. It will be equipped with two injectionchains: for heavy (including a booster – a small super-conducting synchrotron) and light ions, and a storagering where particle collisions are planned. The storagering of racetrack shape has a maximum magnetic rigid-ity of 45 T×m and a circumference of 503 m. The max-imum field of superconducting dipole magnets is 1.8 T.14.4 The NICA program 523NICA will provide a variety of heavy-ion beams up toAu79+ with a kinetic energy up to 4.5 GeV/u. Colli-sions of high-intensity proton beams with a high degreeof longitudinal or transverse polarization and with to-tal energy up to 13.5 GeV will also be available [4558].
Major accelerator challenges include strong intra-beamscattering and space-charge effects which will be par-tially compensated by extensive use of electron andstochastic cooling systems.
Fig. 14.4.1 View of the NICA site.
Two experimental setups with different physics pro-grams will run at two interaction points located in theopposite straight sections of the racetrack ring. TheMultiPurpose Detector (MPD) placed at the first inter-action point will study hot and dense baryonic matterin heavy-ion collisions with luminosity up to 1027 cm−2s−1. The Spin Physics Detector (SPD) in the secondinteraction point is dedicated to the study of the spinstructure of the proton and deuteron and other spin-related phenomena inp-p and d-d collisions with lumi-nosity up to1032 cm−2 s−1. In addition, the heavy-ionbeams can be extracted to the fixed-target experimen-tal setup BM@N (Baryonic Matter at Nuclotron) whosemain goals are investigations of strange/multi-strangehyperons, hypernuclei production, and short-range cor-relations. Extracted beams will also be used for appliedresearch.AviewoftheNICAsiteisshowninFig. 14.4.1while Fig.14.4.2 represents the schematic layout of theaccelerator complex.
The implementation of the physic program of theNICA complex is envisioned in three main stages: i)heavy-ionphysicswithafixedtarget(BM@N),ii)heavy-ion physics in the colliding mode (MPD), and iii) spinphysics (SPD). The possibility of using NICA in theelectron-ion collider mode in the future is under discus-sion.
14.4.1 The study of dense and hot strongly in-teracting matter at NICAAsymptotic freedom has a very deep importance forhadronic matter under extreme conditions. At suffi-ciently high nuclear density or temperature, averageinter-parton distances become small and their interac-tion strength weakens. Above a critical energy densityof about 0.3GeV/fm3, a gas of hadrons passes througha deconfinement transition and becomes a system of un-bounded quarks and gluons called quark-gluon plasma(QGP). An evidence of this transition has been ob-tained from lattice simulations of QCD, in the form of arapid increase of the entropy density around the criticalenergy density. The deconfinement of quarks and glu-ons is accompanied by a restoration of chiral symmetry,spontaneously broken in the QCD vacuum.
The phase diagram (see Fig. 7.1.9 translates theproperties of strong interactions and their underlyingQCD theory into a visible pattern. Recent lattice cal-culations have shown that for vanishing baryon chemi-cal potential,µB, and at a pseudocritical temperature156.5 ±1.5 MeV, a crossover transition happens fromthephasewithabrokenchiralsymmetrytotherestoredchiral symmetry phase [448, 4559]. Different effectivemodels conclude that at higherµB, the transition fromthe ordinary hadron-matter phase to a phase, wherechiral symmetry is restored, is of first order. The cor-responding critical endpoint is an object of desire ofexperimenters and theorists, however, its existence isnot established yet.
The major goal of MPD and BM@N experimentsat NICA is to explore the QCD phase diagram by thestudy of in-medium properties of hadrons and the nu-clearmatterEquationofState(EoS),includingasearchfor possible signals of deconfinement and/or chiral sym-metry restoration phase transitions, and the QCD crit-ical endpoint. The range of energies and interactionratescoveredindifferentheavy-ioncollisionexperimentsincluding MPD and BM@N experiments at NICA ispresented in Fig.14.3.18.
The BM@N experimentBM@N is a fixed-target experimental setup operatingwithextractedionbeamsfromtheupgradedNuclotron.
The main final goal of the BM@N experiment is thecomprehensive study of the early phase of nuclear in-teraction at high densities of nuclear matter (3-4n0)via registration of strange and multi-strange particles(kaons, Λ, Ξ and Ω hyperons, double hypernuclei, etc.)production with enormous statistical precision. Investi-gation of the reaction dynamics and nuclear equation ofstate, as well as the study of the in-medium properties524 14 THE FUTUREFig. 14.4.2 The NICA accelerator complex at JINR.
of hadrons, are also planned. In order to provide nor-malization for the measured A+A spectra, a study ofelementary reactions (p+p, p+n(d)) will be performed.
The layout of the expected full configuration of theBM@N setup is shown in Fig.14.4.3. The tracking sys-tem consists of the silicon strip sensors, and gaseousdetectors and is partially placed inside the analyzingmagnet with a field up to 1.2 T. Particle identificationis provided by the multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber-based Time-of-Flight system. A Zero Degree Calorime-ter is foreseen for the extraction of the collision impactparameter and centrality determination. The BM@Nsetup currently operates in test mode.
Fig. 14.4.3 Layout of the BM@N detector [4560].
The relevant degrees of freedom at the Nuclotronenergies are first of all nucleons and their excited statesfollowed by light and strange mesons [4561]. The focusof experimental studies at BM@N will be on hadronswith strangeness, which are early produced in the col-lision and not present in the initial state of two col-liding nuclei. The measured production yields of lightand strange mesons, as well as of hyperons and anti-hyperons are shown in Fig.14.4.4 as a function of thenucleon-nucleon collision energy. The Nuclotron heavy-ion beam-energy range corresponds to√sNN = 2.3–3.5GeV. It is well suited for studies of strange mesons andmulti-strange hyperons which are produced in nucleus-nucleuscollisionsclosetothekinematicthreshold.Heavy-ion collisions are a rich source of strangeness, and cap-turing Λ-hyperons by nucleons can produce a variety oflight hyper-nuclei [4562, 4563]. In heavy-ion collisions,light hypernuclei are expected to be abundantly pro-duced at low energies due to the high baryon density.
However, the production mechanisms of hypernuclei inheavy-ion collisions are not well understood, due to thescarcity of data. The study of hyper-nuclei productionis expected to provide new insights into the propertiesof the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interac-tions. Figure14.4.5 presents the yields of hyper-nucleias a function of the nucleon-nucleon collision energyin the center-of-mass system in Au+Au collisions, pre-dicted by a thermal model [4564]. The maximum in the14.4 The NICA program 525hyper-nuclei production rate is predicted at√sNN =4-5 GeV, which is close to the Nuclotron energy range.
Short-range correlations in nuclei (SRC) are an ad-ditionaltopicforstudyatBM@N.Inanattempttosim-plify the description of the nuclei as complex stronglyinteracting systems, we tend to separate their short-and long-range structure. Effective field theories de-scribe the long-range structure using a mean-field ap-proximation. The short-range structure of nuclei canbe described in terms of nucleon-nucleon short-rangecorrelations. SRC are brief fluctuations of two nucleonswith high and opposite momenta, where each of them ishigher than the Fermi momentum for the given nucleus.
Hard knock-out reactions where the beam probe in-teracts with a single nucleon are the standard way tostudythepropertiesofSRCpairs.InthepilotstudiesatBM@N the new approach with the inverted kinematicswas used [4565]: a carbon beam with the momentumof 4GeV/c per nucleon scatter off a liquid hydrogentarget. A proton with momentum from the SRC pairis scattered off a target proton. Two protons from the(p,2p) reaction were detected by a two-arm spectrome-ter while aA−2 nuclear fragmentwasidentifiedvia p/Zratio. The events with10B and 10Be fragments corre-sponded top-nand p-pSRC pairs, respectively. The di-rectexperimentalevidencefortheseparationofthepairwavefunction from that of the residual many-body nu-clear system was obtained. All measured reactions arewell described by theoretical calculations that includeno distortions from the initial- and final-state interac-tions (Fig. 14.4.6). The obtained results illustrate theability to study the short-distance structure of short-lived radioactive nuclei at the forthcoming FAIR andFRIB facilities.
The MPD experimentMPD is a collider experiment designed to perform acomprehensive scan of the QCD phase diagram withbeamspeciesfromprotonstogoldbyvaryingthecenter-of-mass collision energy from 4 to 11GeV per nucleonwhich is complementary to the RHIC beam energy scantowards lower energies. The unique feature of MPD asa collider experiment is the invariant acceptance at dif-ferent beam energies as compared to fixed-target exper-iments [4567].
To reach this goal, the experimental program in-cludes the simultaneous measurement of the observ-ables which are sensitive to high density effects andphase transitions. The observables measured on event-by-eventbasisareparticleyieldsandratios,correlationsandfluctuations.Differentspeciesprobedifferentstagesof the nucleus-nucleus interaction due to their differ-ences in mass, energy and interaction cross-sections.

stage but may quickly decouple due to their low interac-tion cross section with the surrounding matter. Amongvarious characteristics, the elliptic flow deserves spe-cial attention because this collective motion is formedmainly in the early stage of the collision. The spatio-temporal information on the particle freeze-out source,which depends on the preceding evolution of the sys-tem, is provided by the measurement of identical par-ticles interference. The direct information on hot anddensetransientmatterisprovidedbypenetratingprobes,photons and leptons. In this respect, vector mesonswhich contain information on chiral symmetry restora-tionareveryattractive.Measurementofthepositive/neg-ativepion asymmetry with respect to the reaction planeasafunctionofcentralityofheavy-ioncollisionsopensapossibility to touch such fundamental problem as spon-taneous violation of CP parity in strong interactions.
The physics program of the first stage of the MPDexperiment includes the following items [4568]:– multiplicity and spectral characteristics of the iden-tifiedhadronsincludingstrangeparticles,multi-strangebaryonsandantibaryonscharacterizingentropypro-duction and system temperature at freeze-out;– event-by-event fluctuations in multiplicity, charges,transverse momenta and K/π ratios as a genericproperty of critical phenomena;– collective flow effects (directed, elliptic and higherones) for hadrons including strange particles;– femtoscopywithidentifiedparticlesandparticlecor-relations.
In the second stage, the physics with electromagneticprobes (photons and dileptons) will be accessed.
The behaviour of hadron abundances along the hy-drodynamictrajectoriesofheavy-ionexperimentsisclose-ly related with the properties of the strongly interact-ing matter near the phase transition. For example, apromising observable to study the onset of deconfine-ment is the pion-to-kaon ratio. TheK+ yield is propor-tional to the overall strangeness production and pionscan be associated with the total entropy produced inthe reaction. Thus, theK+/π+ production ratio can bea good measure of strangeness-to-entropy ratio, whichis different in the confined phase and the QGP. The ex-perimental results forK+/π+, K−/π− and Λ/π+ ra-tios as a function of collision energies in the wide energyrange are shown in Fig.14.4.7. The experimental pointsin the most interesting region around√sNN = 10 GeVhave large uncertainties that could be significantly re-duced by the measurements at MPD.
Fig. 14.4.7 K+/π+, K−/π− and Λ/π+ ratios as a functionof √sNN [2159].
Measurements of event-by-event fluctuations havebeen performed by the numerous fixed-target and col-lider experiments. Recent STAR measurements fromtheRHIC-BESprogram[ 2180]indicateanon-monotonicbehaviour of the excitation function for the net-protonmoments in central Au+Au collisions in the region be-low √sNN = 20 GeV, which can be a hint for the criti-cal point in the range of finite baryon number density.
At MPD the region below 11GeV will be scanned withmuch higher precision.
The main task of femtoscopy, the technique of two-particle correlations in momentum space, is to measurethe space-time evolution of the system created in par-ticle collisions. The two-pion correlation functions areexcellent candidates for first-day physics measurementsatMPD.Femtoscopymeasurementsforpionshavebeenperformed in several previous experiments. Fig.14.4.8presents the energy dependence of the freeze-out vol-ume, obtained from two-pion interferometry. A non-monotonic behavior of this volume in the NICA energyrange raises interest in such measurements at MPD.
The anisotropic collective flow is also one of thepromising observables sensitivite to the transport prop-erties of the strongly interacting matter, in particular,14.4 The NICA program 527Fig. 14.4.8 Freeze-out volume for pions as a function of thecollision energy [4569].

Relativistic viscous hydrodynamic models havebeensuccessfulindescribingtheobservedanisotropy vnfor the produced particles in the collisions of heavy ionsat RHIC and the LHC [2150, 4570, 4571]. The directedflowv1 can probe the veryearly stages of the collision asit is generated during the passage time of the two collid-ing nuclei. The results of a model-to-data comparisonfor the elliptic flowv2 at √sNN = 7.7GeV and 4.5GeVmay indicate that at NICA energies a transition occursfrom partonic to hadronic matter. The high-statisticsdifferential measurements of vn, that are anticipatedfrom the MPD experiment at NICA, are expected toprovide valuable information about this parton-hadrontransient energy domain [4572, 4573].
The layout of the MPD setup is shown in Fig.14.4.9[4573]. The components of the MPD barrel part havean approximate cylindrical symmetry. The beam lineis surrounded by the large gaseous Time ProjectionChamber (TPC) which is enclosed by the TOF barrel.
The TPC is the main tracker, and in conjunction withthe TOF they will provide precise momentum mea-surements and particle identification. It is placed ina highly homogeneous magnetic field of up to 0.57 T.
The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECal) is placed inbetween the TOF and the MPD Magnet. It will beused for detection of electromagnetic showers, and willplay the central role in photon and electron measure-ments. In the forward direction, the Fast Forward De-tector (FFD) is located still within the TPC barrel.
It will play the role of a wake-up trigger. The ForwardHadronic Calorimeter (FHCal) for determination of thecollision centrality and the orientation of the reactionplane is located near the Magnet end-caps. At the mo-ment, this detector configuration is at the assemblingstage.
Additionaldetectorslikethesilicon-basedInnerTrackerSystem for precision secondary vertex reconstruction,the miniBeBe detector for triggering and start time de-termination, and the cosmic ray detector on the outsideof the magnet yoke are proposed for the later stages.

14.4.2 The spin structure of proton and deuteronin the SPD experimentWhile the main goal of the BM@N and MPD experi-ments is to study deconfinement, the third experiment,SPD, aims to study the internal structure of the pro-ton and deuteron using polarized beams. In the po-larized proton-proton collisions, the SPD experiment[4574] will cover the kinematic gap between the low-energy measurements at ANKE-COSY and SATURNEand the high-energy measurements at the RelativisticHeavy Ion Collider, as well as the planned fixed-targetexperiments at the LHC (see Fig.14.4.10). The pos-sibility for NICA to operate with polarized deuteronbeams at such energies is unique. SPD is planned to beoperated as a universal facility for comprehensive testsof the basics of the QCD. The main efforts, however,will be devoted to the study of the unpolarized and po-larized gluon content of the proton at large Bjorken-x,using different complementary probes [4575].528 14 THE FUTURE10 100 s281029103010311032103310-1s-2L, cm1PHENIX & STAR (RHIC, BNL) p↑− p↑ANKE (COSY, Julich) p↑− p↑SPD (NICA, JINR) p↑− p↑SPASCHARM (U-70, Protvino) p↑− p↑AFTER & LHCspin (LHC, CERN) p − p ↑E704 (Fermilab) p↑− p↑SATURNE II Saclay p↑− p↑, GeVFig. 14.4.10 NICA SPD and the other past, present, and fu-ture experiments with polarized protons.
Quantum chromodynamics has remarkable successindescribingthehigh-energyandlarge-momentumtrans-fer processes, where quarks and gluons that are thefundamental constituents of hadrons, behave, to someextent, as free particles and, therefore, the perturba-tive QCD approach can be used.

The parton distributions could be appliedalso to describe the spin structure of the nucleon thatis built up from the intrinsic spin of the valence andsea quarks (spin-1/2), gluons (spin-1), and their orbitalangular momenta.
Inrecentyears,thethree-dimensionalpartonicstruc-ture of the nucleon became a subject of careful studies.
Precise mapping of the three-dimensional structure ofthe nucleon is crucial for our understanding of QCD.
One of the ways to go beyond the usual collinear ap-proximation is to describe the nucleon content in themomentumspacebyemployingtheso-calledTransverse-Momentum-Dependent Parton Distribution Functions(TMD PDFs) [1286, 3189, 3190, 4576–4578].
Considerable progress has been achieved during thelast decades in the understanding of the quark contri-bution to the nucleon spin, yet the gluon sector is muchless developed. One of the difficulties is the lack of di-rect probes to access the gluon content in high-energyprocesses.
The final goal of the SPD experiment is to provideaccess to the gluon TMD PDFs (see Table14.4.1) in theproton and deuteron via the measurement of specificsingle and double spin asymmetries in the productionof charmonia, open charm, and high-pT prompt pho-tons. The kinematic region to be covered by SPD forthese processes (Fig.14.4.11) is unique and has neverbeen accessed purposefully in polarized hadronic col-lisions. Quark TMD PDFs, as well as spin-dependentfragmentation functions, could also be studied. The re-sults expected to be obtained by SPD will play an im-portant role in the general understanding of the nucleongluon content and will serve as a complementary inputto the ongoing and planned studies at RHIC, and fu-ture measurements at the EIC (BNL) and fixed-targetfacilities at the LHC (CERN). Simultaneous measure-ment of the same quantities using different processes atthe same experimental setup is of key importance forthe minimization of possible systematic effects.

However, sucha simplified picture failed to describe the HERMES ex-perimental results on theb1 tensor structure function[819]. A unique possibility to operate with polarizeddeuteron beams brings us to the world of the tensorstructure of the deuteron (tensor PDFs). A possiblenon-baryonic content in the deuteron could be accessedvia the measurement of the gluon transversity distribu-tion and the comparison of the unpolarized gluon PDFsin the nucleon and deuteron at high values ofx.
Nevertheless, the largest fraction of hadronic inter-actions involves low-momentum transfer processes inwhich the effective strong coupling constant is largeand the description within a perturbative approach isnot adequate. A number of (semi-)phenomenologicalapproaches have been developed through the years todescribe strong interaction in the non-perturbative do-main starting from the very basic principles. They suc-cessfully describe such crucial phenomena as the nu-clear properties and interactions, hadronic spectra, de-confinement, various polarized and unpolarized effects14.5 QCD at FAIR 529in hadronic interaction, etc. The transition between theperturbative and non-perturbative QCD is also a sub-ject of special attention. In spite of a large set of exper-imental data and huge experience in a few-GeV regionwith fixed-target experiments worldwide, this energyrange still attracts both experimentalists and theoreti-cians.

SPD has an extensive physics program for the firststage of the NICA collider operation with reduced lu-minosity and collision energy of the proton and ionbeams, devoted to comprehensive tests of the variousphenomenological models in the non-perturbative andtransitional kinematic domain. It includes such topicsas the spin effects in elastic scattering, in exclusive re-actions as well as in hyperons production, multiquarkcorrelations and dibaryon resonances, charmonia andopen charm production, physics of light and interme-diate nuclei collision, hypernuclei, etc. [4579]. The pro-posed program covers up to 5 years of the NICA colliderrunning.
The SPD experimental setup, shown in Fig.14.4.12,is designed as a universal4π detector with advancedtracking and particle identification capabilities basedon modern technologies, consisting of the barrel partand two end-caps. The silicon vertex detector will pro-vide a reconstruction of secondary vertices ofD-mesondecays. The straw-tube-based tracking system placedwithin a solenoidal magnetic field of up to 1 T shouldprovide tracking capability. The time-of-flight systemwill provide π/K and K/p separation together withan aerogel-based Cherenkov detector in the end-caps.

To minimize possible systematic effects, SPD willbe equipped with a free-running (triggerless) DAQ sys-tem. The SPD experimental setup is currently in thephase of the technical project preparation.

14.5 QCD at F AIRJohan Messchendorp, F rank Nerling, andJoachim Stroth14.5.1 The F AIR facilityThe international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Re-search FAIR (14.5.1) is an accelerator complex cur-rentlyconstructedatthesiteofthenationalGSIHelmholtzCenter for Heavy-ion Research, Germany. It is com-posed of a rapid cycling synchrotron with maximumrigidity 100 Tm providing beams directly to experimen-talhallsandtoproductiontargetsforsecondaryionandanti-proton beams [4580]. A high-energy storage ring(HESR) enables experiments with antiproton and rareradioactive isotope beams. The latter are selected outof either nuclear fragments or fission products, emerg-ing from reactions of e.g. relativistic uranium beams bythe Super Fragment Separator (S-FRS), providing high530 14 THE FUTUREFig. 14.5.1Layout of the FAIR accelerator complex. See textfor the meaning of the various acronyms.
transmission for reaction products and high selectivityand purity for selected rare isotopes [4581].
The scientific goals encompass many open questionsconnected with the formation of matter and the role ofthe strong force herein. The respective activities areorganized in three pillars, hadron physics using anti-proton annihilation (PANDA), heavy-ion reactions atrelativisticenergies(CBM),andnuclearstructurephysicsat the limit of stability using relativistic, stored or de-celerated rare isotope beams (NUSTAR). For the latter,not discussed in the remainder of this section, FAIR willpursue a unique approach enabling nuclear structurestudies of e.g. the r-process isotopes relevant for thethird r-process abundance peak. Acceleration of 28+uranium ions in the SIS100 will push the space chargelimit and yet provide beam energies around1 A GeV[4582].SIS100isparticularlydesignedtoacceleratemed-ium charge state ions with a fast cycling rate of 1 Hz.
This is achieved ramping the superconducting dipolemagnets with4 T/s to a maximum field of 1.9T [4583].
Combined with the large acceptance and transmissionof the Super-FRS, separated fission fragments will pro-vide fully stripped isotope beams up to the neutrondrip line. Such beams can be transferred to a stor-age ring for precision mass measurements (ILIMA), di-rected to a secondary target in the high-energy experi-ment hall for reaction experiments (R3B), or to exper-iments utilizing γ-spectroscopy in flight (HISPEC) orwith stopped beams (DISPEC). Complementary exper-iments can also be performed at the Super-FRS operat-ing the second half of the separator as high-resolutionforward spectrometer and using a secondary target inthe middle section of the separator (Super-FRS EC).
Last not least isotope beams can also be deceleratedand trapped (MATS) or investigated using laser spec-troscopy (LaSpec). FAIR will also give home to manyother experimental collaborations working in fields ofatomic physics, radio biology, plasma physics and ma-terial science (APPA).
Civil construction of the accelerator complex hasbeen started in 2017 focusing on the north area of thecomplex. As of 2022, the shell construction of the ringtunnel, the transfer buildings, the reaction experimentcave and the Super-FRS is mostly finished and the tech-nical building installation has been started. The facil-ity will be completed in a staged approach aligned withthe funding profile and first beam from SIS100 to theCBM cave is anticipated for 2028. A FAIR early scienceprogram will be started as soon as the Super-FRS is in-stalled providing uranium beam from SIS18 directly tothe separator. Already now, a rich research program isongoing at GSI and various other international facilitiesemploying instrumentation developed for FAIR (FAIRPhase-0).
14.5.2 CBM - QCD studies under extreme baryonconditionsTheresearchpillar Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM)is addressing the physics of QCD matter under ex-treme conditions of baryon density and temperature.
In a dedicated experiment hall, ion beams extractedfrom SIS100 will be directed onto stationary targets toform transients states of QCD matter in central colli-sions. The formation process is expected to reach max-imum baryon densities of around five times the nuclearground-state density at temperatures of up to100 MeV.
Model calculations suggest that e.g. in a Au+Au colli-sion at a fewAGeV, the incoming nucleons are stoppedto a large extent in the collision zone and that thenuclear matter is compressed to densities of ρmax ≃1 fm−3 [4584]. It is expected that the formed hadronicsystem is approaching local equilibrium before it freezesout chemically at densities aroundρch ≃0.1 fm−3 (seeSection 7.1). At such initial densities, the system canno longer be understood as resonance gas, but ratheras an entangled meson cloud surrounding the baryoniccores (see Section7.2).
Figure 14.5.3 demonstrates the world-wide effortsthat explore the high-µB-region (high net-baryon den-sity) obtained at lower beam energy (c.f.7.1) of theQCD phase diagram by means of heavy-ion collisions.
Please note that by today no experiment has crossedthe 50 kHz line.
The CBM collaboration has designed an experimentto investigate heavy-ion collisions with emphasis on thedetection of rare and penetrating probes. Figure14.5.2shows the configuration of the Compressed Baryonic14.5 QCD at FAIR 531Fig. 14.5.2 Computer rendering of the two experiments CBM and HADES installed in the FAIR fixed-target experimental hall.
In case CBM is operated, the beam pipe is continuing through the center of the HADES experiment up to the CBM dipole(target vacuum chamber and beam pipe are not drawn). In case HADES is taking beam, a beam stop is placed between the twoexperiments (half transparent cube shown on a stand). The HADES setup is shown with blue support structure.

The planesare arranged over1 m downstream the target. The firstfour planes are composed of monolithic pixel sensors,manufactured in a 180nm CMOS process, and pro-vide a total of 140 M-Pixels right behind the targetand placed inside the beam vacuum (MVD). Behind,and outside the vacuum region, eight planes of sili-con strip sensors constitute the core tracking system(STS). This tracking system is contained in a mag-netic dipole field providing a maximum bending powerof 1 Tm. Behind the tracking station different detec-tor systems can be placed, depending on the observ-ables to be addressed. In the standard configuration, aring-imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) provides su-perb electron/positron identification up to momenta ofaround 4 GeV. Behind, four stations of transition radia-tion detector enable intermediate tracking, energy lossmeasurement and additional electron/positron identifi-cation for high momentum tracks (TRD). The last de-tector is a wall of multichannel resistive-plate counters(TOF) covering about20 m2 in the transverse plane.
It provides a high-precision time signal to enable parti-cle identification by velocity vs momentum of chargedparticles. The CBM detector uses a trigger-less dataacquisition system where every individual detector cellis digitized and where signals passing their thresholdsreceive a timestamp. Data streams of up to a TeraByteper second are transferred to the online compute clusterwhere real-time event building and feature extraction isperformed. By selecting events with signatures of inter-est, the data stream is reduced to a level that allowsstorage on disks. Up to 40.000 compute nodes will beneeded to accomplish this task in the case of operatingat thehighest interactionrate. The compute cluster willbe installed in the FAIR Green Cube. The online eventselection and rejection requires a high level of under-standing and monitoring of the detector performanceat the time of the data taking. To gain experiences andto prepare all software and firmware for fast calibrationand event reconstruction, the CBM collaboration hasinstalled a small version of the CBM detector at SIS18beam line of GSI. This mini-CBM setup is composedout of prototypes or first-of-a-series modules of each de-tector system of CBM. The detectors are arranged asa single arm telescope and are operated without mag-532 14 THE FUTUREBaryochemical potential (MeV)0200 400 600 800 1000 Temperature (MeV)0501001502002500〉qq〈BµT,〉qq〈0.90.80.70.60.50.30.20.10.050.02CEPDeconfinementandchiraltransition/T<2B µ /T<3B µNucleiLiquid-GasHadronsQuark-gluon plasma-µ+µ-e+eFig. 14.5.3 The QCD phase diagram as function of temper-ature and baryo-chemical potential.

The prime goal of the CBM program at FAIR isto search for signatures of a first-order phase transi-tion, separating the hadron resonance gas region froma likely novel state of matter (cf. 7.2). The establishedstrategy for this is to search for non-monotonic behav-ior of the excitation function of various observables,or more general for trends signaling a change in thenumber of degrees of freedom of the transient systemlike the (dis)appearance of a certain scaling behavior.
An example is the excitation function of the multiplic-ity of multi-strange hyperons. The high-rate capabilityof CBM will enable such measurements well below theproton-proton production threshold119.
Indeed, the region in the QCD phase diagram athigh baryo-chemical potential is by largeterra incog-nita.Figure 14.5.3depictstheQCDphasediagramwithexperimentallandmarksandpredictionsbylatticeQCD.
The landmarks include, first, chemical-freezeout pointsthat characterize the temperature and the baryochemi-cal potential below which the system can be understoodas an expanding hadron gas in which inelastic collisionsno longer occur. Two additional points are shown whichdepict an average temperature of the dense and hot119 The threshold is here defined as the energy needed to pro-duce a given hyperon in an elementary proton-proton collisionand the beam energy is referred to as√sNN.
system prior to freeze out. This very promising observ-able, so far not addressed in excitation functions withthe needed precision, is the spectral distribution andyield of dileptons emitted from the dense and hot stageof the collision. Such dileptons couple via virtual inter-mediary photons directly to the in-medium hadroniccurrent-current correlator and thus probe the micro-scopic structure of the medium they are expelled from[4585, 4586]. In the so-called low-mass region (LMR),i.e. for dilepton invariant masses around the vector-meson pole masses ρ,ω and φ and below, the spec-tral distribution encodes the “melting” of the vectormesons embedded in a hot and dense hadronic environ-ment, while the dilepton spectrum from a purely par-tonic medium would not feature any particular struc-ture. Moreover, the integral yield of continuum dilep-tons in the LMR dominantly depends on the size, thelifetime and the temperatures of the emitting source. Ithas been demonstrated using a hydro model that thefireball ball evolution can significantly change if duringthe evolution the system experiences a phase transitionfrom a QGP-like to a hadronic equation-of-state. Thestudy observed an increase of the yield by roughly afactor of two in the case of a first-order phase transi-tion [4587]. Dilepton continuum radiation also providesa model independent measurement of the average tem-perature of the emitting source. This is possible if theimaginary part of the in-medium current-current corre-latorissufficientlyfeaturelessandapproachingadepen-dence ∝T2/M2. In that case, the spectral distributionis defined essentially by the thermal Bose factor andthe invariant-mass distribution takes the form of black-body radiation, i.e.∝(MT)3/2 exp (−M/T) [4588]. Afit of a Planck distribution function to the spectral dis-tribution in the respective invariant mass reveal an in-variant measurement of that average temperature, un-affected by any blue shift due to rapid expansion of theemitting source. The two measurements of the averagetemperature shown in Fig.14.5.3 were obtained by theNA60 collaboration in the dimuon channel [4589] andby the HADES collaboration in the dielectron channel[4590]. The “trajectories” indicated as dashed-dottedlines depict the evolution of the fireball used to inte-grate the emissivity over the four-volume characteriz-ing the evolution of the collision zone. For details see[4590].
In order to obtain the continuum radiation, contri-butionstothedileptoninvariant-massdistributionfromthe early pre-equilibrium stage and from late decays oflong-lived hadronic states have to be determined andsubtracted [4591]. An important part of the CBM pro-gram are therefore reference measurements of elemen-tary collision systems or the production of dileptons in14.5 QCD at FAIR 533Fig. 14.5.4Di-electron excess radiation measured by HADESfor the collision system Au+Au at√sNN = 2 .42 GeV (blacksquares).

collisions of protons on nuclei. For this, the HADESdetector will be moved to the SIS100 experimental hallwhere it will be installed in front of the CBM detec-tor. HADES, with its large polar acceptance, is wellsuited to study in particular the production and prop-agation of vector mesons in cold nuclear matter. Thefeasibility of reconstructing the dilepton continuum ra-diation in heavy-ion collisions at energies SIS18 ener-gies has been demonstrated for the system Au+Au at√sNN = 2 .42 GeV. Figure14.5.4 depicts the respectiveinvariant-massdistributiontogetherwithvariousmodelcalculations. It is important to note that at this colli-sion energy, theρmeson is substantially broadened dueto the high baryon density, thus satisfying the criteriafortemperaturemeasurementoutlinedabovealsointheLMR.
14.5.3 P ANDA - Hadron structure & spectroscopystudies using antiprotonsPhysics with antiprotons and PANDAThe ambition of PANDA is to exploit the annihilationof antiprotons with protons and nuclei to study theproperties of hadrons and their interactions with un-precedented precision and coverage in parity, spin, andgluon and quark flavor contents. Partly as the succes-sor of the successful LEAR facility at CERN, PANDAwill combine a high-resolution and intense antiprotonbeam with a state-of-art detector system. The exper-iment is designed to produce hadrons with masses ofup to about 5.5 GeV/c2 and to unambiguously detect alarge variety of final-state particles with excellent mo-mentum resolution, particle identification capabilities,and exclusivity.
PANDA will be an internal-target experiment in-stalled at the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR).
The antiproton beam from HESR has several key ad-vantages, namely i) the production cross sections ofhadrons are generally large, resulting in large data sam-ples; ii) meson-like states of any quark-antiquark spin-parity combination can be produced in formation witha superb mass resolution; iii) baryon-antibaryon pairs,including multi-strange and charm, can be producedin two-body reactions, which provide clean conditionsfor baryon studies; iv) proton-antiproton annihilationsconstitute a gluon-rich environment.
In the initial phase, HESR will be able to store1010 antiprotons with momentap from 1.5 GeV/c upto 15 GeV/c. By making use of the stochastic coolingtechnique, the relative beam-momentum spread (∆p/p)will be<5×10−5. The antiprotons will interact with acluster jet target or pellet target, which results in aluminosity during the first phase (Phase One) of datataking of about 1031 s−1cm−2. The final goal is a lumi-nosity of up to 2×1032 s−1cm−2, referred to as PhaseThree.
The PANDA detector is designed to measure mo-menta of charged and neutral final-state particles with1-2% resolution and with excellent particle identifi-cation, vertex reconstruction, and count-rate capabil-ities. The nearly 4π acceptance allows to study ex-clusive reactions covering a large part of their phasespaces, thereby enabling a conclusive partial-wave anal-ysis. The detector consists of a Target Spectrometer(TS) and a Forward Spectrometer (FS). The TS pro-vides precise vertex tracking by the micro vertex detec-tor, surrounded by straw tube trackers and gas electronmultiplier detectors in the forward direction. The tra-jectories of charged particles in the TS are bent by thefield of a solenoid magnet providing a field of 2 T, with534 14 THE FUTUREmuon detectors within the segmented yoke. For particleidentification, the TS will consist of time-of-flight andCherenkov detectors and an electromagnetic calorime-ter composed of PbWO2 crystals. With the electromag-netic calorimeter, nearly covering the full phase spaceusing a barrel and two endcaps, the measurement of en-ergies and scattering angles of photons, electrons, andpositrons will become possible.
The FS consists of straw tube stations for tracking,a dipole magnet, a ring imaging Cherenkov detector,a forward time-of-flight system and a Shashlyk electro-magneticcalorimeter,followedbyamuonrangesystem.
The luminosity at PANDA will be determined by us-ing elastic antiproton-proton scattering as the referencechannel registered by a dedicated luminosity detector.
The combination of the intense, high resolution an-tiproton beam with the nearly 4π PANDA detector,opens up unprecedented possibilities with a very richphysicsprogram,particularlysuitedtoprovideadeeperunderstanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime.
In the following, we discuss some of the QCD-drivenhighlights from the various pillars of the physics pro-gram of PANDA. We note that PANDA has a moreextensive physics program that includes various nuclearphysics aspects as well, such as the foreseen hypernucleiand hyperatom topics. We limit ourselves here to thosetopics in which the quarks, gluon, and their interactionsare expected to be the most important degrees of free-dom. For a more detailed description of the completephysics program at the first phase of the experiment,we refer to [4592].
Hidden charm and exoticsPANDA will be devoted to provide precision data forhadron spectroscopy with light to charm constituentquarks, and gluons. Given the anti-proton beam mo-mentumrangeofupto15GeV/ c,theaccessibleinvariant-mass range in direct formation is about 2 - 5.5 GeV/c2,and the PANDA experiment is thus designed and op-timized to cover the charmonium mass region. In ad-dition, the light quark sector can be explored via theproduction with recoil particles.
Thecrosssectionsassociatedwithantiproton-protonannihilations are generally several orders of magnitudelarger than those of experiments using electromagneticprobes, allowing for excellent statistical precision al-ready at moderate luminosities available in the initialPhase One (∼1031 cm−2s−1).
Inthecharmoniummassregion,differentunexpectedcharmonium-like states have been discovered since thebeginning of the millenium. Some of these so-calledXYZ states are electrically charged and in combina-tion with the mass those are manifestly exotic states.
They have unambiguously a minimum quark contentof four quarks (e.g.c¯cd¯u) and are, among others, dis-cussed to be tetraquark or molecular states in form of alooselybounddi-meson system.PANDAwillcontributeto solve the puzzle of the nature of these unexpectedcharmonium-like XYZ states. Moreover, there is a num-ber of pentaquark states and other exotic candidatesreported by LHCb recently that will be accessible withPANDA.
InordertounderstandthenatureoftheXYZstates,e.g. which of the different four-quark configurations arerealized by nature, and to confirm further candidatesreported, PANDA will play an unique role. The dif-ferent multiplets need to be completed, especially thecorresponding high-spin states. Those can uniquely beaddressed by PANDA, since there is no restriction inproduced JPC quantumnumbersin ¯ppannihilationandthanks to the mostly 4π acceptance of the detector.
Given the excellent electromagnetic calorimetry in thebarrel as well as in the forward part of the detector,PANDA will have full acceptance not only for chargedbut also for neutral final-state particles.
Another crucial and unique tool are precision line-shape measurements. The energy-dependent resonancecross sections of these states are strongly connectedwith the inner structure of such states – theoretical in-terpretations come along with predictions for absolutedecay widths and line shapes. The narrow and famousX(3872),meanwhilerenamedbythePDGto χc1(3872),was the first of these XYZ states discovered in 2003[4596]. Its nature is still not understood.
As shown by a comprehensive Monte Carlo basedfeasibility study [4593], the line shape of narrow states,particularly the X(3872), can be measured preciselyand directly by PANDA with sub-MeV resolution, Fig.
14.5.5,allowingforsortingoutmodels,Fig. 14.5.5,right.
Thanks to the unprecedented beam momentum and en-ergy resolution of the HESR of up to∆p/p= 2 ×10−5and∆Ecms/Ecms = 34 keV,evenverysimilarline-shapemodels can be discriminated by employing the tech-nique of a resonance energy scan [4593].
At LHCb, it was not possible to distinguish be-tween a Breit-Wigner and a Flatté-like line-shape forthe X(3872) even though huge statistics has been ac-cumulated [4594]. This state cannot be produced indirect formation at LHCb, and the energy-scan tech-nique cannot be employed. Consequently, the resolu-tion of the measurement is dominated by the detectorresolution (order of a few MeV) and the LHCb dataare equally well described using both line-shape models(Fig. 14.5.6).

Center: Thesame two line shapes when including backgrounds and resolution,i.e. convolved with the detector resolution.

guishing these two different line-shape models has beeninvestigated and quantified [4595]. The achievable per-formancehasbeenevaluatedintermsofthemis-identifi-cation probabilityPmis to assign the wrong line-shapemodel, namely the Breit-Wigner line shape for MonteCarlo data generated using a Flatté line shape, and viceversa. The outcome is summarized in Fig.14.5.7, wherethe resultant sensitivities in assigning the correct lineshape (shown here for the Flatté-like line shape) arebetterthan90%and98%,dependingonthegivenaccel-erator operation mode (Fig.14.5.7, left). For this figureof merit, a mis-identification probability ofPmis = 50%corresponds to “indistinguishable”. To answer the ques-tion, how much better the expected PANDA perfor-mance is as compared to “indistinguishable”, one mayconsider the so-called “odds” defined as the numberof correct assignments per wrong one: odds := (1 −Pmis)/Pmis. The corresponding results are shown in Fig.
14.5.7 (right). Using this measure, PANDA is expect tobe at least a factor of 10 better than “indistinguish-able”, a feature that is only possible due to PANDA’sexcellentbeam-momentumresolutionandthedirectfor-mation of theX(3872) state in antiproton-proton an-nihilations.
Concerningthelight-quarkandgluonsector,PANDAwill search for exotic forms of matter such as hybridmesons and glueballs. In the mass range accessible atFAIR, a large number of glueballs is expected and someof them might be narrow. Their SU(3) structure can bedetermined from an analysis of their decay modes.536 14 THE FUTUREPRELIMINARY9−8.5 −8 −7.5 −7 −6.5 −6 −5.5 −5 − [MeV]fE0102030405060 [%] mis P HL modeP1 modeHR mode = 50nb)σMis-ID Flatte as BW (ANDAPMC studyPRELIMINARY9−8.5 −8 −7.5 −7 −6.5 −6 −5.5 −5 − [MeV]fE110210310odds ratioHL modeP1 modeHR mode = 50nb)σOdds ratio (ANDAPMC studyFig. 14.5.7Performances to distinguish between a Breit-Wigner and a Flatté-like line shape with PANDA/HESR at FAIR.Left:Sensitivity in terms of the mis-identification probabilityPmis to wrongly assign the Breit-Wigner line shape instead of the correctFlatté-like line shape as a function of the Flatté energy parameterEf, whereasPmis = 50 % corresponds to “indistinguishable”.

Using this measure, the expected performance is at least ten times better than “indistinguishable”, i.e. as it isachieved based on the LHCb data [4594], see also [4595].
For light hybrid mesons, such as theπ1(1400) andπ1(1600), the most conclusive results so far have beenprovided by the COMPASS experiment at CERN/SPS,employing a 190 GeV/cpion beam, see e.g. [4597–4599].
The GlueX photoproduction experiment has been con-structed and is dedicated to map the full spectrum ofhybrid mesons with masses of up to about 2.5 GeV/c2.
Thefindingsbybothoftheseexperimentsandothersonhybrids as well as on non-exotic new light meson states,such as the [4600], will complementary be addressedin ¯pp annihilation processes at PANDA. These kind ofinvestigations will moreover be extended to the char-monium region, for which several glueball and hybridstates are predicted, e.g. a spin-exotic state at about4.2 GeV/c2 [4601].
Presently, there is no experiment dedicated to glue-balls. In comparison to glueball searches inJ/ψ decayse.g. at BESIII, they are expected to be produced withorders of magnitude higher production rate in¯ppanni-hilation [4602]. In particular in the charm region, glue-ball candidates with masses above 4 GeV/c2 are pre-dicted, some of which might be narrow and could thusbe found. An analysis of their decay fraction could beused to decide if the state has a large glueball compo-nent.
Strangeness physicsWith antiproton-proton annihilations and baryon num-ber conservation, the final state has zero total baryonnumber. This feature has the advantage that relativelyclean two-body final-state topologies may emerge in-volvingexclusivelyabaryontogetherwithitsantibaryon.
The maximum center-of-mass foreseen with PANDAamounts to 5.5 GeV/c2 which provides access to pro-duce pairs of various hadrons including strange andcharm quarks such as¯pp→Λ¯Λ, Σ¯Σ, Ξ¯Ξ, Ω¯Ω, Λc ¯Λc,Σc ¯Σc, Ξc ¯Ξc, Ωc ¯Ωc, together with various excited statesof these hadrons. The production of these pairs has var-ious benefits, namely i) close to the appropriate produc-tion threshold, the identification and analysis of thesereactions are fairly simple, since one may apply taggingmethods, deal with limited number of partial waves,and with a good signal-to-background level; ii) com-bined with the excellent momentum resolution of theinitial antiproton beam, a near-threshold scan allowsto determine basic properties, such as mass and width,of these states, and their excitations very accurately[4603]; iii) the self-analyzing feature of the weak decaysof these (anti)baryons can be exploited to study spindegrees-of-freedom of their production process. The lat-ter feature is a powerful tool that can be used for vari-ous physics aspects ranging from particle physics (testCP conservation in the hyperon sector), spectroscopystudies (baryon resonances with strangeness), and spinphysics (detailed study of hyperon production and in-teractions). In the following, we highlight two aspectsthat will be foreseen with PANDA, namely the spin-physics and hyperon-spectroscopy programs.
The spin-physics program of PANDA aims to mea-sure accurately differential cross sections and spin ob-servablessuchaspolarizationandspincorrelations.Theseobservables provide a deeper understanding of the spinproduction mechanisms or, more generally, of the dy-namics that lead to the production of hyperons in anti-proton proton collisions. Which effective degrees of free-dom are adequate to describe the hadronic reaction dy-namics: quarks and gluons or mesons and baryons? Andhow does this picture change with center-of-mass en-ergy? The high production rates of hyperon and anti-hyperon pairs in combination with the excellent signal14.5 QCD at FAIR 537to background yield give perfect conditions to performthese measurements. Already with moderate initial lu-minosities, a spectacular production rate of hyperonand antihyperon pairs are to be expected. The reaction¯pp →Λ¯Λ, with Λ →pπ− and ¯Λ →¯pπ+, was studiedin detailed Monte Carlo simulations. At a luminosityof 1031 cm−2s−1 and at a antiproton beam momentumof 1.64 GeV/cwe expect 3.8×106 of fully reconstructedΛ¯Λ pairs per day. For strangeness|S|= 2 baryon pairsvia ¯pp → ¯Ξ+Ξ− at a beam momentum of 4.6 GeV/c,the expected rate is about 2.6×104/day exclusively re-constructed pairs in theΞ− →Λπ− and ¯Ξ+ → ¯Λπ+decay modes. Moreover, the signal-to-background ratiois estimated to be better than 100 (250) for the ¯ΛΛ(¯Ξ+Ξ−) channel. With the perspectives of PANDA toreach the high luminosity conditions at HESR at PhaseThree, precision studies of hyperons with charm con-tents will become feasible and CP violation tests willbecome competitive [4604].
PANDA’s environment to produce abundantly pairsof hyperons and antihyperon is also the ideal setting tocarryoutdetailedspectroscopystudiesofthesebaryons.
The underlying physics motivation is to understand theinternal structure of baryons. For this purposes, baryonspectroscopy has demonstrated to be a very power-ful tool. In the case of PANDA, the conceptual ideais to replace light valence quarks of the (anti)protonwith heavier strange and charm ones via the processessketches above, measure the excitation spectrum of ex-cited hyperon states, determine their properties such asmass, width, spin, parity, and decay modes, and com-pare such observations between the various baryonicsystems including those of the light-quark sector, i.e.
N∗ and ∆ resonance levels. With these measurementssome of the open questions will be addressed, such asi) Which baryonic excitations are efficiently and welldescribed in a three-quark picture and which are gen-erated by coupled-channel effects of hadronic interac-tions? ii) To which extent do the excitation spectra ofbaryons consisting ofu, d, s obey SU(3) flavor symme-try?iii)Arethereexoticbaryonstates, e.g. pentaquarksor dibaryons? iv) What is the role of diquark correla-tions inside baryons? v) Can we understand the missingresonance phenomena and the observed level orderingin the light-quark baryon sector? PANDA has the po-tential to be the key player in providing conclusive datafor the strangeness |S| = 2 ,3 (anti)baryons therebycomplementary to the future activities planned at J-PARC [4605] and the wealth of baryon spectroscopydata that have been obtained with photo- and pion-induced reactions at JLab, ELSA, MAMI, GRAAL,Spring-8, HADES, etc.. As an illustration of the capa-bilities of PANDA to determine spin-parity assignmentof excitedΞ∗ states, we refer to the results of a prelim-inary feasible study described in [4606].
Nucleon structureIn the past 60 years, the structure of the proton hasbeen extensively studied with great success exploitinglepton-hadron scattering (see Section 10). With the an-nihilation of antiproton with protons, it will be pos-sible to extract electromagnetic form factors (EMFF)and structure functions of the (anti)proton in a re-gion of phase space not accessible using electromagneticprobes.
EMFFs quantify the hadron structure as a func-tion of the four-momentum transfer squared q2 andare defined on the complexq2 plane. Space-like EMFFs(q2 < 0) are real functions ofq2 and have been stud-ied extensively using elastic electron-hadron scatter-ing. Time-like EMFFs are complex and will be stud-ied at PANDA using different processes in variousq2regions. Figure 14.5.8 sketches the various processesthat can be exploited to study EMFFs for variousq2regions. Here, B, B1 and B2 denote various baryons.
With antiproton-proton annihilations, EMFFs of the(anti)proton will be probed for theq2 range startingfrom the unphysical region, using the reaction ¯pp →e+e−π0, to high-q2 via ¯pp→ℓ+ℓ− whereby ℓ refers toboth electrons and muons. Detailed Monte Carlo sim-ulations demonstrated that bothGE and GM can bemeasured with a precision of about 3% in the e+e−final state at q2 around 5 (GeV/c)2 and with a totalintegrated luminosity of 0.1 fb−1, which is well suitablefor the first years of data taking. Figure14.5.9 depictsthe present state-of-the-art of theR= |GE|/|GM|mea-surements as a function ofq2 together with the preci-sion perspectives of PANDA for the early phases of theexperiment (green band) and for the high luminositymode (purple band). PANDA will be able to harvestmorepreciseform factordata comparedto today’smea-surement and extend the measurements towards highervalues of q2 including, for the first time, both the di-electron and di-muon as probes. Being analytic func-tions ofq2, space-like and time-like form factors are re-lated by dispersion theory. With the future data takenat PANDA and the various other complementary fa-cilities, it will become feasibly to rigorously test theanalyticity and universality of the measured EMFFs.
Besides measuring the EMFFs of the (anti)proton, alsotransition form factors (B1 ̸= B2) are accessible. Withthe copious production of hyperons and antihyperonsin antiproton-proton collisions, PANDA will provideunique data to extract transition form factors of var-ious hyperons and their corresponding antihyperons.538 14 THE FUTURE-Q2 = q2 < 0 q2 = 0 q2 = (mB1–mB2)2 q2 = (mB1+mB2)2q2Unphysical regionҧ𝑝𝑝 → 𝑒+𝑒−𝜋0Low-q2𝐵1 → 𝐵2𝑒+𝑒−𝐵1 → 𝐵2𝛾Space-like𝑒−𝐵 → 𝑒−𝐵1𝑒−𝑒+High-q2𝑒+𝑒− → 𝐵ത𝐵ത𝐵𝐵 → 𝑒+𝑒−𝐵2𝐵1𝑒+𝑒−π0ҧ𝑝ҧ𝑝𝑝𝑒−𝑒+𝐵ത𝐵𝑒− 𝑒−𝐵 𝐵Fig. 14.5.8 The various processes that are used to extract information about the EMFF in the space-like (q2 <0) and time-like(q2 > 0) regions.

With PANDA operating at the highest beam ener-gies, the partonic degrees of freedom at distances muchsmaller than the size of the proton can be studied viameasurements of various structure functions. A key insuch studies is the factorization theorem stating thatthe interaction can be factorized into a hard, reaction-specific but perturbative and hence calculable part anda soft, reaction-universal and measurable part. In thespace-likeregion,probedbydeepinelasticlepton-hadronscattering, the structure is described by parton distri-bution functions (PDFs), generalized parton distribu-tions (GPDs), transverse-momentum-dependent partondistribution functions (TMDs), and transition distri-bution amplitudes (TDAs). These observables extendthe information provided by EMFFs and give furtherinsight in the spatial and momentum distributions ofthe constituent partons and the spin structure. WithPANDA, the time-like counterpart becomes experimen-tallyaccessibleviahardproton-antiprotonannihilations.
Detailed studies to accessπN TDAs at PANDA in thereactions ¯pp →γπ0 →e+e−π0 and ¯pp →J/Ψπ0 →e+e−π0 can be found in [4607, 4608]. For these mea-surements, as well as for the TMD studies, the designedhigh luminosity of PANDA is needed to accumulate rea-sonable statistics. The counterparts of the GPDs in theannihilation processes are the generalized distributionamplitudes (GDAs). They can be measured in the hardexclusiveprocesses ¯pp→γγ [4609]and ¯pp→γM [4610,4611], whereM could be a pseudo-scalar or vector me-son (e.g.π0, η, ρ0, φ). Differential cross section mea-surements become already feasible to study with thePhase One luminosity of PANDA during the first yearsof data taking.

The program will continue for at least the next 5-10years, building on the data sets already collected, andensuring the BESIII collaboration will remain a keyplayer in future global efforts in hadron spectroscopy,flavor physics, and searches for new physics. The maxi-mumenergyofBEPCIIwillsoonbeupgradedto5.6GeV,and there are plans to more than double the BEPCIIluminosity at high CM energies by increasing the maxi-mumachievablebeamcurrents.Belowwebrieflyoutlinea few highlights from BESIII, how these achievementshave contributed to global physics efforts, and how thenext era at BESIII will build on this momentum. Moredetails and references can be found in a recent whitepaper describing the future physics program at BESIII[4620] and in a recent contribution to the 2021 Snow-mass process [snowmass].

14.6.2 The BEPCII-U UpgradeBEPCII delivered its first physics data in 2009 on theψ(2S) resonance. Since then, BESIII has collected morethan 40 fb−1 of integrated luminosity at different CMenergies from 2.0 to 4.95 GeV. In order to extend thephysicspotentialofBESIII,twoupgradeplansforBEPCIIwere proposed and approved in 2020. The first upgradewill increase the maximum beam energy to 2.8 GeV(corresponding to a CM energy of 5.6 GeV), which willexpand the energy reach of the collider into new terri-tory. The second upgrade will increase the peak lumi-nosity by a factor of 3 for beam energies from 2.0 to2.8 GeV (CM energies from 4.0 to 5.6 GeV).
To perform these upgrades, BEPCII will increasethebeamcurrentandsuppressbunchlengthening,whichwill require higher RF voltage. The RF, cryogenic, andfeedback systems will be upgraded accordingly. Nearlyall of the photon absorbers along the ring and some vac-uum chambers will also be replaced in order to protectthe machine from the heat of synchrotron radiation.
The budget is estimated to be about 200 million CNYand it will take about 3 years to prepare the upgradedcomponents and half a year for installation and com-missioning, which will start in June 2024 and finish inDecember 2024. With these upgrades, BESIII will en-hance its capabilities to exploreXYZ physics and willhave the unique ability to perform precision measure-ments of the production and decays of charmed mesonsand baryons at threshold.
14.6.3 Hadronic Production: via direct e+e− an-nihilationPrecisionmeasurementsofhadronproductionhelpmakeQCD-related models more reliable and help test SMparameters with an unprecedented sensitivity. BESIII540 14 THE FUTUREhas advanced our knowledge of hadron production us-ing both inclusive and exclusive approaches, mainly viadirect production ine+e− collisions.
R value measurementThe R ratio, defined as the lowest-order cross sectionfor inclusive hadron production,e+e− →hadrons, nor-malized by the lowest-order cross section for the QEDprocess e+e− →µ+µ−, is a central quantity in par-ticle physics. Precision measurements of the R ratiobelow 5 GeV contribute to the SM prediction of themuon anomalous magnetic moment. TheR ratio alsocontributes in the determination of the QED runningcoupling constant evaluated at theZ pole. In a firstmeasurement at BESIII [4621], 14 data points with CMenergies from 2.2324 to 3.6710 GeV are used for the in-clusive R value measurement. An accuracy of betterthan 2.6% below 3.1 GeV and 3.0% above is achievedin theRratios, as shown in Fig.14.6.2. Previous resultshad uncertainties at the level of 3-6%. The averageRvalue in the CM range from 3.4 to 3.6 GeV obtained byBESIII is larger than the corresponding KEDR resultand the theoretical expectation by 1.9 and 2.7 standarddeviations, respectively.
The complete data set for the R value measure-ment at BESIII consists in a total of 130 energy pointswith an integrated luminosity of about 1300pb−1, cor-responding to more than105 hadronic events at eachof the points between 2 and 4.6GeV. Thus, the finalresult is expected to be dominated by a systematic un-certainty of less than 3%.

Fragmentation functionsFragmentationfunctionsdescribetheprobabilityoffind-ing a given hadron within the fragmentation of a quark,and carrying a given fraction of the quark momentum.
Precise knowledge of fragmentation functions are essen-tial ingredients for studies of the internal structure ofthe nucleon as carried out by semi-inclusive deep in-elastic scattering (SIDIS) experiments (e.g.at a futureElectron-Ion Collider). At BESIII, using data collectedin the continuum energy region, unpolarized fragmen-tation functions are extracted from inclusive hadronproduction processes e+e− →h+ X, whereh denotesπ0, η, KS, or charged hadrons. Polarized fragmenta-tion functions, i.e. the Collins effects, have been ob-tained by BESIII using pairs of pions produced at√s=3.65 GeV [4622]. In the future, the Collins effect forstrange quarks could be studied ine+e− →πK + Xand e+e− →KK+X. It is also interesting to study theCollins effect in neutral hadrons likee+e− →PP′+ Xwith P/P′= π0/η.
Exclusive cross section measurements using initial stateradiationThe dispersive integral formalism used to determine theHVP contribution toaµ relies heavily on the hadronice+e− cross sections at CM energies√s ≤2 GeV. AtBESIII, these energies are only accessible by exploit-ing the initial state radiation (ISR) method. With aninitial data set of 2.83 fb−1 at √s = 3 .773 GeV, thistechniquealreadyproducesresultscompetitivewiththeB-factories for hadronic masses above approximately1.3GeV.
InafirstmeasurementbyBESIII,thelargesthadroniccross section, fore+e− →π+π−, was measured in themass region from 600 to 900MeV by reconstructing theISR photon at large angles only [4218]. With 20fb−1of data at√s= 3 .773 GeV expected soon, a new mea-surement of the π+π− cross section will use the im-proved statistical accuracy to implement an alterna-tive normalization scheme relative to the muon yield.
With this approach, the largest uncertainties will can-cel, bringing the expected final uncertainty down to0.5%, as illustrated in Fig. 14.6.3. Additionally, themulti-meson cross sections fore+e− →π+π−π0 as wellas e+e− →π+π−π0π0 have been measured using thesame analysis strategy. Uncertainties of approximately3% were achieved. These cross sections can be used tostudy resonances in the final state as well as in the in-termediate states. Further improvements are expectedwith additional data at√s= 3.773 GeV.
Meson transition form factorsTransition form factors (TFF) of mesonsM describethe effects of the strong interaction on theγ∗γ∗M ver-tex. At BESIII, TFFs are studied in the region of time-like virtualities through meson Dalitz decays and ra-diative meson production ine+e− annihilations.

The produc-tion of higher meson multiplicities in two-photon fusionallows access to scalar, tensor and axial resonances. Thesingle-tagged strategy allows for the production of axialmesons due to the presence of a highly virtual photon.
A first measurement of thef1(1285) will be performedusing the π+π−η final state for reconstruction. Withthe upcoming data set of 20fb−1 at √s = 3 .773 GeVall two-photon fusion analysis will benefit from higherstatistics, which will be sensitive to higher virtualities.
Time-like baryon form factorsThe simplest observables for nucleon structure are theelectromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) that arise fromtheir charge and magnetization distributions, and pro-vide a crucial testing ground for QCD-related models.
At BESIII, the|GE/GM|of the proton in the time-likeregion is determined over a largeq2 from threshold to9.5 GeV2 with the best precision reaching 3.7% [4623].
The cross section ofe+e− →n¯n [4624] is found to besmaller than that ofe+e− →p¯p. The effective FFs ofthe neutron show a periodic behavior, similar to earlierobservations of proton FFs reported by BaBar. The en-ergyregionofBESIIIcoverstheproductionthresholdofall SU(3) octet hyperons and several charmed baryons.
At BESIII, the Born cross sections of electron-positronannihilation to various baryon pairs are measured fromthreshold [4625], including Λ¯Λ, Σ¯Σ, Ξ¯Ξ and Λc ¯Λ+c .
Obvious threshold effects are observed. The|GE/GM|of theΛ, Σ+, andΛc are obtained from angular analy-ses while effective FFs are extracted for other baryons.
Moreprecisedataorfinerscansarenecessaryfordeeperinsight into these results. The hyperon EMFFs and thecross section line shapes can also be studied with im-provedprecisionviaISRapproacheswitha20fb −1 dataset collected at√s= 3.773 GeV.
The EMFFs in the time-like region are complex andthe relative phase between GE and GM will lead tothe transverse polarization of the final baryons. At BE-SIII, the relative phase of theΛis determined at√s=2.396 GeV with a joint angular distribution analysis, tobe ∆Φ= 37◦ ±12◦ ±6◦ [4626]. Combining with the ob-tained |GE/GM|at the same CM energy, the completeEMFFs are determined for the first time. Similarly, therelative phase of theΛc is determined at√s= 4.60 GeV[4627]. The currently available data set from√s= 4 .6to 4.95 GeV will help complete determinations ofΛcEMFFs in a wideq2 range. As the energy dependenceof the relative phase is essential for distinguishing var-ious theoretical predictions, a complete determinationof EMFFs for SU(3) octet hyperons are necessary in thefuture.
Precision measurement of the τ massThe τ lepton is one of three charged elementary lep-tons in nature, and its mass is an important parameterof the Standard Model. The τ mass can and shouldbe provided by experiment precisely. Precisionτ massmeasurements probe lepton universality, which is a ba-sic ingredient in the Standard Model.
To aid in theτ mass measurement, a high-accuracybeam energy measurement system (BEMS), located atthe north crossing point of BEPCII, was designed, con-structed, and finally commissioned at the end of 2010.
By comparing aψ(2S) scan result with the PDG valueof theψ(2S) mass, the relative accuracy of the BEMSwas determined to be at the level of2 ×10−5 [4628].
The BESIII collaboration performed a fine mass scanexperiment in the spring of 2018. Theτ mass scan datawere collected at five scan points near theτ pair pro-duction threshold with total luminosity of 137 pb−1.
The analysis is in progress. The uncertainty, including542 14 THE FUTUREstatistical and systematic error, will be less than 0.1MeV.
14.6.4 Hadron Spectroscopy: from light to heavyLight Hadron PhysicsQCD allows for a richer meson spectrum than the con-ventional quark model predicts, including tetraquarkstates, mesonic molecules, hybrid mesons and glueballs.
Lattice QCD predicts the lightest glueballs to bescalar, tensor and pseudo-scalar, allowing mixing withthe conventional mesons of the same quantum num-bers. Generally, glueballs are expected to be producedin gluon-rich processes such as radiativeJ/ψ decays,so that the high-statisticsJ/ψ sample puts BESIII ina unique position to study glueball candidates. Partialwave analyses (PWA) of the radiative decaysJ/ψ →γπ0π0, γK0SK0S and γηη reveal a strong production ofthe f0(1710) and f0(2100) [4629]. One might speculatethat these resonances have a large gluonic component.
Similarly, the tensor meson f2(2340) is strongly pro-duced in the radiative decays J/ψ → γηη and γφφ[4629], rendering it a good candidate for a tensor glue-ball. Two recent coupled channel analyses [4630, 4631]of BESIII data on radiativeJ/ψ decays came to differ-ent conclusions concerning the number of contributingresonances and the identification of a glueball candi-date, so that additional studies using the full 10 billionJ/ψ data sample will be of high importance in the fu-ture.
Based on 10 billionJ/ψ events, the decayJ/ψ →γf0(1500) →γηη′ has been observed with a significanceover30σ while J/ψ →γf0(1710) →γηη′ is found to beinsignificant [2409, 2410]. The suppressed decay rateof the f0(1710) into ηη′ lends further support to thehypothesis that f0(1710) has a large overlap with theground state scalar glueball [4632].
In the search for the pseudo-scalar glueball, the de-cay J/ψ →γη′π+π− has proven to be particularly in-teresting [4629]. Here, the X(1835) can be observedwith a lineshape that appears to be distorted at theproton anti-proton threshold, indicating a potentialp¯pbound-state or resonance. In addition, the higher massstructuresX(2120),X(2370) andX(2600) areobserved,as shown in Fig.14.6.4, although their spin-parity re-mains to be determined, a task that will be possibleusing the new, high precisionJ/ψ data.
Motivated by multiple studies of the hybrid mesoncandidate π1(1600), a recent search for the isoscalarpartner statesη1 and η′1 in the radiative decaysJ/ψ →γηη′ revealedasignificantcontributionfromanewstruc-ture η1(1855) with exotic quantum numbers JPC =1−+ [2409, 2410]. While it is too early to say whetherFig. 14.6.4 The invariant mass spectrum of the final stateπ+π−η′ for J/ψ → γπ+π−η′ candidates. A series of new par-ticles are observed includingX(1835), X(2100), X(2370) andX(2600). Figure taken from Ref. [4633].
the η1(1855) is indeed an isoscalar hybrid meson, futurestudies of alternative decay modes will help reveal itsnature.
The light scalar mesonsf0(980) and a0(980) are fre-quently discussed as potential multiquark candidates,eitheras K ¯Kmoleculesorascompacttetraquarkstates.
One possible way to probe their structure is the studyof f0(980) - a0(980) mixing first observed by BESIIIin the isospin-violating processesJ/ψ →φa00(980) andχc1 → π0f0(980) [4629]. These results provide con-straints in the development of theoretical models con-cerning thef0(980) and a0(980).
With 10 billionJ/ψ decays and the newly acquired2.7 billionψ(2S), precision studies of conventional andexotic mesons, including multiquark states, glueballsandhybridmesons,inradiativeandhadronic J/ψ,ψ(2S)and χcJ decays will be key tasks in the coming years.
Light baryon spectroscopyThe high production rate of baryons in charmoniumdecays, combined with the large data samples ofJ/ψand ψ(2S) decays produced from e+e− annihilations,provides excellent opportunities for studying excitedbaryons. Therefore, the BES experiment launched aprogramtostudytheexcitedbaryonspectrum.Atpresent,the search for hyperon resonances remains an impor-tant challenge. Some of the lowest excitation resonanceshave not yet been experimentally resolved, which arenecessary to establish the spectral pattern of hyperonresonances. The large data samples ofJ/ψ and ψ(2S)decays accumulated by the BESIII experiment enableus to complete the hyperon (e.g.,Λ∗, Σ∗ and Ξ∗) spec-trum and examine various pictures for their internalstructures.Suchpicturesincludeasimple 3qquarkstruc-ture or a more complicated structure with pentaquark14.6 BESIII 543components dominating. In particular, ψ(2S) decays,because of the larger mass of theψ(2S), have great po-tential to uncover new higher excitations of hyperons.
At BESIII, 1010 J/ψ and 2.7 ×109 ψ(2S) decaysare now available, which offer great additional oppor-tunities for investigating baryon spectroscopy. Togetherwith other high-precision experiments, such as GlueXand JPARC, these very abundant and clean event sam-ples will bring the study of baryon spectroscopy into anew era, and will make significant contributions to ourunderstandingofhadronphysicsinthenon-perturbativeregime.
Charmonium physicsBelow the open-charm threshold, the spin-triplet char-monium states are produced copiously ine+e− annihi-lation and in B decays so they are understood muchbetter than the spin-singlet charmonium states, includ-ing the lowest lying S-wave stateηc, its radial excitedpartner ηc(2S), and the P-wave spin-singlet statehc.
The 2.7 billion ψ(2S) decays at BESIII make it pos-sible to study the properties of these states with im-proved precision. In addition, the unexpectedly largeproduction cross section for e+e− →π+π−hc in theBESIII high-energy region provides a new mechanismfor studying thehc and ηc (from hc →γηc).
The coupling of vector charmonium states to theopen-charm meson pairs will provide crucial informa-tioninidentifyingthestatesinthisregion.Thehadronicand radiative transitions between the (excited) char-monium states can be investigated to study the tran-sition rates and decay dynamics. The cross section ofe+e− → ηJ/ψ [4634] shows an enhancement aroundthe ψ(4040) mass, while the cross sections ofe+e− →π+π−ψ(3770) [4635]and e+e− →π+π−ψ2(3823) [4636]show an enhancement around theψ(4415) mass. Theprocess e+e− →γχcJ is studied to search for radia-tive transitions between the excited vector charmoniumstates and theχcJ [4637]. Whether they are producedvia hadronic transitions from the excited vector char-monium states or via vector charmonium-like states isnot yet clear and can be addressed using improved lu-minosity and more decay channels.
Using thee+e− →π+π−ψ2(3823) process, the mostprecisemassofthe ψ2(3823) hasbeendetermined[ 4636]andnewdecaymodesofthe ψ2(3823) havebeensearchedfor[4638].These recentmeasurementsatBESIIIare ex-amples that the transitions between charmonium statescan also serve as production sources of non-vector char-monium states, and can be used to study the properties(mass, width and decay modes) of non-vector charmo-nium states. They will also be important study topicsin the future at BESIII.
With a dedicated data sample taken in theχc1 massregion, the direct production of theC-even resonance,χc1, ine+e− annihilation is observed for the first timewith a statistical significance larger than5σ [4639]. Atypical interference pattern around theχc1 mass is ob-served as shown in Fig. 14.6.5. The electronic widthof theχc1 has been determined for the first time froma common fit to the four scan samples to be Γee =(0.12+0.13−0.08) eV, in contrast of a few keV for vector states,which is 4 orders of magnitude smaller. This observa-tion proves that the direct production ofC-even res-onances through two virtual photons is accessible andmeasurableatthecurrentgenerationofelectron-positroncolliders.

XYZ physicsThe discovery of the XYZ states has revolutionized tra-ditional studies of the charmonium spectrum [4640].
These exotic states cannot be embedded in the con-ventional charm-anticharm potential model framework,but instead point towards novel quark configurations,such as tetraquarks, hybrids, or hadronic molecules.
Studying them opens a new window into nonperturba-tive QCD, which underlies the formation of hadrons viathe strong interaction. The existence of the XYZ statesposes several problems, which are addressed as the “Yproblem”, “Z problem”, and “X problem” below.
The Y problemBESIII has systematically measured the cross sectionsofvariousexclusive e+e− annihilationswithhiddencharm,open charm, and light hadronic final states [4640], andhas shown that the lineshapes are complicated as a544 14 THE FUTUREfunction of CM energy. The masses and widths of var-ious structures appearing in these cross sections areshown in Fig.14.6.6. However, the extracted parame-ters of theseY states are not consistent with each otherin different channels. Furthermore, they deviate fromthe resonances observed in inclusive channels, such asthe ψ(4040), ψ(4160), andψ(4415), that are believed tobe conventional charmonia. This leads to theY prob-lem. What are the exact lineshapes of these cross sec-tions? Are these observed structures new resonances orjust results of some subtle kinematic effects? To addressthese issues, a detailed scan between 4.0 and 4.6 GeVis proposed [4620], with 500 pb−1 per point, for pointsspaced at 10 MeV intervals. This target has been par-tially achieved with about 22 fb−1 integrated luminos-ity, and will be updated with larger maximum energy(5.6 GeV) after the upgrade of the BEPCII.

[4641].
The Z problemThe Zc(3900) [4640] was discovered at BESIII in theprocess e+e− →π∓Z±c with Z±c →π±J/ψ, and theZc(4020) was discovered in the processe+e− →π∓Z±cwith Z±c → π±hc. The Zc(3900) has also been ob-served in the open-charm channel(D¯D∗ + c.c.)±, sim-ilarly theZc(4020) was seen via the open-charm chan-nel (D∗ ¯D∗)±. Furthermore, neutral partners of thesecharged Zc states have been observed at BESIII viaprocesses e+e− →π0π0J/ψ and e+e− →π0π0hc. BE-SIII has also determined the quantum numbers of theZc(3900) to beJP = 1+. Recently, BESIII has observeda new near-threshold structure in theK+ recoil-massspectra ine+e− →K+(D−s D∗0 + D∗−s D0) [2514]. Thisstructure, named Zcs(3985), is a good candidate for acharged hidden-charm tetraquark with strangeness. Be-sides, the evidence for its neutral partner,Zcs(3985)0is observed viae+e− →KS(D+s D∗− + D∗+s D−) [4642].
However, at the energy region higher than 4.3 GeVthe data have revealed more complex structure in theDaliz plots ofe+e− →π+π−J/ψ. A similar situationis found in thee+e− →π+π−ψ(2S) [4643]. This is theZ problem. Are the properties of theseZc states con-stant (corresponding to real resonant states) or energydependent (corresponding to kinematic effects such ascusps or singularities)? What are the exact lineshapesof them? Can we find more decay patterns for them, es-pecially for the newly discoveredZcs states? Are therespinmultipletsofthese Zc states?Toanswertheseques-tions, BESIII may take advantage of the fine scan datamentioned before, but at a few points, a set of sampleswith very high statistics will be very helpful. BESIIIcurrently has 1 fb−1 of data for e+e− cms energy at4.23 and 4.42 GeV. Additional data including three orfour points with an order of 5 fb−1 or more per pointis proposed to guarantee adequate statistics for ampli-tude analyses [4620]. After the upgrade of BEPCII withtriple the luminosity, this goal will be achieved moreeasily.
The X problemFor the X(3872), BESIII has discovered the processe+e− →γX(3872), studied the open-charm decay andradiative transitions of theX(3872), and has observedthe hadronic transitions X(3872) → π0χc1(1P) andX(3872) →ωJ/ψ [4640]. TheX(3872), with its quan-tum numbersJPC = 1++, has a mass very close to thepredictedχc1(2P) statewithaverynarrowwidth.Thenthe X problem is finding a way to separate theX(3872)from theχc1(2P). Is theX(3872) really exotic or con-ventional, or even a mixture state? Can we measurethe line shape of theX(3872)? Are there otherX states(forexampleclosetothe D∗ ¯D∗ threshold)thathavenotbeen observed yet? The related studies will benefit fromthelargescanandotherdatasamplesmentionedbefore.
Furthermore, atEcm >4.7 GeV with highly excitedψor Y states produced, the hadronic transitions, thattake larger production rates than the radiative transi-tions, are accessible. After the upgrade of BEPCII toits maximum CM energy, BESIII will have the abilityto search for the J++ states via hadronic transitionssuch as the processese+e− →ωX and e+e− →φX.
RelationshipsThere are two kinds of relationships that deserve dis-cussion. One is the relationship between XYZ statesand conventional charmonia. For example, theχc1(2P)has a similar mass and the sameJPC as theX(3872).
So a detailed understanding of the spectrum of the con-ventional 2P charmonium states, that include the spin14.6 BESIII 545triplet χcJ(2P) and singlethc(2P), is crucial for under-standing the nature of theX(3872). This is also truefor the other conventional charmonia and XYZ statesunder similar conditions. The studies of the conven-tional charmonia and exotic XYZ are complementaryto each other. Understanding the relations between thetwo kinds of states, even the possible mixing betweenthem, will be helpful for understanding the propertiesof the XYZ states. The other relationship is amongthe XYZ states. The analyses of processes e+e− →γX(3872) and e+e− →π0π0J/ψ have already shownthatthereisevidencefortheradiativetransition Y(4230) →γX(3872) and the hadronic transition [4640]Y(4230) →π0Z0c(3900).
Searchingfornewtransitionmodesandconfirmingtheserelations may be a unique chance for BESIII to revealthe nature of the internal structure of the XYZ states[4644].
Pentaquark statesTheLHCbexperimentreportedtheobservationofthreepentaquark states with a c¯c component in the J/ψpsystem via Λ0b → J/ψK−p. To confirm these states,further experimental research should be pursued withthe current available and the forthcoming experimen-tal data [4645]. BESIII may search for such and similarstates with data to be collected at CM energies above5 GeV in the processese+e− →J/ψp+ X, χcJp+ X,J/ψΛ + X, ¯D(∗)p + X, D(∗)p + X, and so on. It isclear that a systematic search for baryon-meson reso-nances should be pursed in various processes, where thebaryon could bep, Λ, Σ, Σc, ..., and the meson couldbe ηc, J/ψ, χcJ, D(∗), etc. It is worth pointing outthat the tetraquark and pentaquark candidates men-tioned above have a pair of charm-anticharm quarkswhich may annihilate. Observations of states likeT+cc(ccud) orΘ0c (uudd¯c) orP0cc (ccdd¯u) or similar serve asmore direct evidence for multiquark states. The BESexperiment pioneered a search for the pentaquark can-didate Θ(1540) in ψ(2S) and J/ψ decays toKSpK−¯nand KSpK+n[4646]. More attempts will be performedwith 10 billionJ/ψ and 3 billionψ(2S) at BESIII.
14.6.5 Hadron Decay: from light to heavyLight meson decaysTheηandη′ mesons,theneutralmembersofthegroundstatepseudoscalarnonet,areimportantforunderstand-inglowenergyquantumQCD[ 4647].The10billion J/ψevents collected at BESIII offer an unique opportunityto investigate all these aspects, as well as the searchfor rare η and η′ decays needed to test fundamentalQCD symmetries and probe physics beyond the SM.
The decays J/ψ →γη(η′) and J/ψ →φη(η′) provideclean and efficient sources ofη/η′ mesons for the decaystudies.
The observation of newη′ decay modes [4648], in-cluding η′ →ρ∓π±, η′ →γe+e−, and η′ →4π havebeen reported for the first time using about109 J/ψdecays. Using the same data set, the branching frac-tions of the five dominant decay channels of theη′ weremeasured for the first time using events in which theradiative photon converts toe+e−.
The double Dalitz decayη′ →e+e+e−e− is of greatinterest for understanding the pseudoscalar transitionform factor and the interaction between pseudoscalarandvirtualphotons.Thisprocesshasnotbeenobservedto date, while the predicted branching fraction is of theorder of2×10−6 [4649,4650]. Another interesting studyis the hadronic decayη′ →π0π0η which is sensitive tothe elastic ππ S-wave scattering lengths, and causes aprominent cusp effect in theπ0π0 invariant mass spec-trum at theπ+π− mass threshold [4651]. The fullJ/ψdata set collected by BESIII offers unique opportunitiesto investigate the cusp effect in this decay for which noevidence has yet been found.
The absolute branching fraction of the decayJ/ψ →γη has been measured with high precision using radia-tive photon conversions [4648], and the four dominantη decays have been measured for the first time. Theη/η′ →γπ+π− decay results are related to details ofchiral dynamics;η/η′ →3π decays provide informationontheupanddownquarkmasses;andthedecaywidthsof η/η′ →γγ are related to the quark content of thetwo mesons. Despite the impressive progress in the lastyears, many η and η′ decays are still to be observedand explored. The fullJ/ψ data set now available atBESIII makes possible more detailed studies with un-precedented precision. It allows, in addition, an inten-sive investigation of the properties of the pseudoscalarstates η(1405)/η(1475) [4648]; a thorough study of allstates observed in the1.4 −1.5 GeV/c2 mass region; adeep investigation of theω→π+π−π0 Dalitz plot; andsearches for rareω decays.
Hyperon decaysObservation of a significant polarization of theΛand ¯Λfrom J/ψ →Λ¯Λ led to the revision of the decay asym-metry parameter αΛ [4652, 4653], and has shown BE-SIII has the potential to study properties of the ground-state (anti)hyperons. Moreover, the cascade decays ofJ/ψ →Ξ−Ξ+ made it possible to measure the strongand weak phases of theΞ− decay [4604]. The branchingfractions for J/ψ decays into a hyperon–antihyperonpairarerelativelylarge, O(10−3),andthusthecollected546 14 THE FUTURE10 billion J/ψ decays can be used for precision stud-ies of hyperon decays and tests ofCP symmetry. Thehyperon–antihyperon pair is produced in a well-definedspin-entangled state based on the two possible partialwaves (parity symmetry in this strong decay allows foran S- and a D-wave). The charge-conjugated decaymodes of the hyperon and antihyperon can be measuredsimultaneously and their properties compared directly.
In the first round of analyses both the hyperon and an-tihyperon decay via the common pionic modes. The fulldatasetwillbeusedtoimprovetheprecisionofthe CP-violation searches within these decays. The next stagewill be to use a common decay of one of the (anti)hyper-ons to study rare decays of the produced partner. Forexample, the kinematical constraints make it possibleto perform complete reconstruction of the semileptonicdecays and radiative decays of polarized hyperons.
Leptonic decays of charm mesonsIn the SM, the partial widths of the leptonic decayD+(s) →ℓ+νℓ canbeexpressedintermsofthe D+(s) decayconstant fD+(s)and the CKM matrix element|Vcd(s)|.
Using the measured branching fractions of the leptonicD+(s) decays,theproduct fD+(s)|Vcs(d)|canbedetermined.
By taking the fD+(s)calculated by LQCD with a pre-cision of 0.2% [4654, 4655], one can precisely deter-mine the CKM matrix elements |Vcs|and |Vcd|.Con-versely, taking the |Vcs|and |Vcd|from the standardmodel global fit, one can precisely measure theD+(s) de-cay constants, which are crucial to calibrate LQCD forheavy-quark studies. Comparing the obtained branch-ing fractions ofD+(s) →τ+ντ and D+(s) →µ+νµ givesan important comprehensive test ofτ−µlepton-flavoruniversality.
Inrecentyears,BESIIIreportedthemostpreciseex-perimental studies ofD+(s) →ℓ+νℓ by using 2.93, 0.48,and 6.32 fb−1 of data taken at√s= 3 .773, 4.009, and4.178-4.226 GeV [4656]. However, the statistical uncer-tainty still dominates studies of D+ → ℓ+νℓ decays,whereas the statistical and systematic uncertainties arecomparable in measurements of D+s → ℓ+νℓ decays.
The full BESIII data samples to be collected in thecoming years allow improvements in the precision ofthese important constants. The current results offD+and |Vcd| and their expected precision are shown inFig. 14.6.7. Furthermore, the accuracy of the lepton-flavor universality tests inD+ →ℓ+νℓ and D+s →ℓ+νℓdecays are expected to be reduced from 24.0% and 4.0%to about 10.0% and 3.0%, respectively.

These measurementswere carried out by using 2.93, 0.48, and 6.32 fb−1 ofdata taken at√s= 3.773, 4.009, and 4.178-4.226 GeV,respectively.
Except for theD0(+) →K and D0(+) →K∗ formfactors, the precision of all other measurements of theD0(+)(s) →P and D0(+)(s) →V form factors are restricteddue to the limited size of the data sets. Therefore, withthe full BESIII data samples, all the form-factor mea-surement uncertainties that are limited by the size ofthe data sample will improve by factors of up to 2.6 forsemi-leptonic D0(+) and 1.4 for semi-leptonicD+s de-cays.Complementarystudiesofthesemi-muoniccharmedmeson decays further improve the form factor knowl-edge. In addition, we plan to extract theD →S andD→A form factors for the first time.
The best precision in thec →s and c →d semi-leptonic D0(+) decay form factors will be from the stud-ies ofD0(+) → ¯Kℓ+νℓ and D0(+) →πℓ+νℓ. Combininganalysis of semi-electronic and semi-muonicD0, as wellas D+ decays will give more precise results. The exper-imental uncertainties are expected to be reduced from0.6% to 0.4% onc→s decays and from 1.5% to 0.7%on c→d decays, as indicated in Fig.14.6.8.
For semi-leptonicD0(+)(s) decays, the best test ofµ−elepton-flavor universality is expected to be fromD →¯Kℓ+νℓ decays, where the test precision can be reducedfrom 1.3% to the level of 0.8% in the near future. Atpresent, it is not conclusive whether theµ−e lepton-flavor universality always holds in semi-leptonicD0(+)(s)decays, because there are still many unobserved semi-muonic decays such asD+ →η′µ+νµ, D0(+) →a0(980)µ+νµ,D0(+) →K1(1270)µ+νµ, D+ →f0(500)µ+νµ,D+s →K0µ+νµ, D+s →K∗0µ+νµ,14.6 BESIII 547D+s →f0(980)µ+νµ, D+s →η′µ+νµ.
Larger data samples provide improved opportunities tosearch for these decays, whose observation will helpclarify if there is violation ofµ−e lepton-flavor uni-versality in the charm sector.
Moreover,thestudiesontheintermediateresonancesin hadronic final states, e.g.,K1(1270) and a0(980), inthe semi-leptonic D0(+)(s) decays provide a clean envi-ronment to explore meson spectroscopy, as no otherparticles interfere. This corresponds to a much simplertreatment than those studies in charmonium decays orhadronic D0(+)(s) decays.

Hadronic decays of charm mesonsSome experiments, for example LHCb, have the abilityto measure a large number of charm and beauty hadronrelative branching-fraction ratios due to the high yieldsgiven by the large charm and beauty production crosssection. The conversion from the branching-fraction ra-tio to the absolute branching fraction incurs the uncer-tainty of the branching fraction of the reference mode,such as, D0 → K−π+, D0 → K−π+π+π−, D+ →K−π+π+, D+s →K−K+π+, and Λ+c →pK−π+. Im-proved measurements of these absolute branching frac-tions at BESIII will be highly beneficial to some keymeasurementsatLHCb.With20fb −1 datatakenaround√s = 3.773 and 4.18 GeV at BESIII, these decays areexpected to be measured with an uncertainty of about1%.
At present, the sum of the branching fractions forthe known exclusive decays ofD0,D+ andD+s are morethan 80%. However, there is still significant room toexplore more hadronic decays to increase the knownbranching fractions for D0, D+ and D+s . A 20 fb−1dataset will allow the determination of the absolutebranchingfractionsofthosemissingdecays Kπππ,KKππ,and KKπππ and exploring the sub-structures in thesedecays using amplitude analyses is also interesting. Inaddition, precise measurements of the branching frac-tions for D0, D+s and D+ inclusive decays to threecharged pions and other neutral particles, and exclu-sive decays to final states with neutral kaons and pions(e.g. D+s →η′π+π0, D+ → ¯K0π+π+π−π0 and decaymodes contributing to D0(+) → ηX) are also highlydesirable to better understand backgrounds in severalmeasurements, particularlyB →D∗τ+ντ.
Studies of such multi-body decays benefit from am-plitude analyses to understand the intermediate reso-nances. Even though it is possible to accumulate largesamples of singly taggedDmesons, they have very highbackgrounds making them unsuitable to perform am-plitude analyses. In contrast to this, the doubly taggedD¯Dmesonscanprovideclean Dsampleswithlowback-grounds. However, the sample size limits the precisionwith the current data. Therefore, such measurementswill be significantly improved with the full BESIII datasets.
Decays of charmed baryonsThe lightest charmed baryon,Λ+c , which was observedin 1979, is the cornerstone of the charmed baryon spec-tra. The improved knowledge ofΛ+c decays, especiallyfor the normalization modeΛ+c →pK−π+, is key forthe studies of the charmed baryon family. Moreover,the Λ+c decays can also open a window upon a deeperunderstanding of strong and weak interactions in thecharm sector. In addition, these will provide importantinputs for the studies of beauty baryons that decay intofinal states involvingΛ+c .
Compared to the significant progress in the studyof charmed mesons, the advancements in the knowl-edge of the charmed baryons are relatively slow in thepast 40 years. Before 2014, almost all the decays ofΛ+c were measured relative to the normalization modeΛ+c → pK−π+, whose branching fraction suffered alarge uncertainty of 25%. Moreover, no data sampletaken around theΛ+c ¯Λ−c pair production threshold hadbeen used to study theΛ+c decays.
BESIIIhavealreadycollected 4.4 fb−1 ofdata aboveΛc ¯Λc threshold, which will provide the most precisevalues of many absolute branching fractions and po-larization parameters [4620]. Future running with theupgraded BEPC-II will allow large samples ofΣc andΞc pairs to be collected, which will lead to many abso-lute branching fractions of charm baryon decays to bedetermined for the first time [4620].
The “post-BEPCII era”The superτ-Charm facility (STCF) [4657] is one of themajor options for future accelerator-based high energyprojects in China. The proposed STCF is a symmetric548 14 THE FUTUREdouble ring electron-positron collider that would oper-ate in the CM region√s= 2 ∼7 GeV with a peakingluminosity of 0.5 ×1035 cm−2s−1 or higher. It is ex-pected to deliver more than 1 ab−1 of integrated lumi-nosity per year. Huge samples of exotic charmonium-like states (XYZ ), J/ψ, D, Ds and Λc decays could beused to make precision measurements of the propertiesof XYZ particles, and map out the spectroscopies ofQCD hybrids and glueballs. High statistics data sam-ples could also be used to search for new sources ofCP violation in the hyperon andτ-lepton sectors withunprecedented sensitivity and search for anomalous de-caysofvarioushadronswithsensitivitiesextendingdownto the level of SM-model expectations.
Since 2012, when the STCF was proposed, the Chi-nese STCF working group, together with internationalteams, have carried out a series of feasibility studies,completed the preliminary Conceptual Design Report(CDR) and made significant progress. Compared to theBEPCII/BESIII experiments, the substantial improve-ment in the performance of the STCF will lay the foun-dation for breakthroughs in the relevant frontiers ofresearch. Meanwhile, it will pose major technical chal-lengesinacceleratoranddetectordevelopment.Atpresent,the STCF project for the research and development ofkey technologies is actively performed with the sup-port of Anhui Province of China. More efforts are beingmade to promote the implementation and constructionof the STCF project.
14.7 BELLE IIT oru IijimaThe Belle II experiment is a particle-physics exper-iment operating at the SuperKEKB collider built inthe KEK laboratory in Japan (Figure14.7.1). It is asuccessor of the Belle experiment at the KEKB col-lider, which experimentally established the Kobayashi-Maskawa theory of theCP violation, together with theBaBar experiment at the SLAC PEP II collider. Overthe next decades, Belle II will record the decay of bil-lions of bottom mesons, charm hadrons, andτ leptonsproduced in electron-positron collisions at and near theΥ(4S) energy. The ultimate goal is to accumulate 50ab−1 data of e+e− collisions, which is about 50 timeslarger than the data set of the Belle experiment. Thesedata, collected in the low background and kinemati-cally known conditions, will provide a complementaryapproach to experiments at hadron machines. It will al-low us to critically test the standard model (SM) andsearch for new particles through processes sensitive tovirtual heavy particles at mass scale orders of magni-tudes higher than direct searches at the energy frontierexperiment.
TheBelleIIphysicsprogramincludesvarietyofsub-jects in the areas of;– Precision CKM measurements to critically test SMand find or constrain non-SM physics contributionin a model-independent way.
– Search for non-SMCP violationin rareBprocesses,such asb→q¯qs.
– Search for non-SM physics in semileptonic, radiativeand other rareBdecays, including precision tests ofthe lepton-universality inb →cℓν and b →sℓ+ℓ−,where ℓ stands for either ofe, µ and τ.

– Provide essential inputs to sharpen the interpreta-tion of results for the anomalous magnetic momentof the muon(g−2)µ, which indicates4.2σdeviationfrom the SM.
In these physics studies at Belle II, the importanceof QCD is two-fold. First, better understandings of non-perturbative QCD properties associated with particledecays are essential ingredients for sharpening the SMpredictions as references for non-SM physics searches.
Second, a variety of low-energy QCD phenomena, suchas thec¯c and b¯b spectroscopy as mentioned above, arethe subjects that could be uniquely studied at the BelleII experiment. Also, thee+e− collisions to hadron finalstatesofferuniqueopportunitiestostudyhadronizationprocesses like the Collins effect. The variety of physicsstudies that can be carried out at Belle II is discussed indetail in Ref. [4658]. In the subsections following14.7.2,we describe only a brief summary for subjects that areof primary relevance to QCD, where Belle II will beunique and will be world-leading.
14.7.1 SuperKEKB/Belle II experimentThe SuperKEKB accelerator is an asymmetric energycollider of 4.0 GeVe+ and 7.0 GeVe−. The target in-stantaneous luminosity is∼6×1035 cm−2 s−1, enabling14.7 BELLE II 549Fig. 14.7.1 Layout of the SuperKEKB accelerator.
accumulation of 50 ab−1 over the next decade. It is theworld’s leading luminosity machine with an innovative“nano-beam scheme”, where the two beams collide witha large horizontal crossing angle and the vertical beamsize is squeezed down to a level of 50-60 nm at the in-teraction point (IP).
The Belle II detector, as shown in Figure 14.7.2,is located at the single collision point (IP) of the Su-perKEKB. It is nearly a4πmagnetic spectrometer sur-rounded by a calorimeter and muon detectors and com-prisesseveralsubdetectorsarrangedcylindricallyaroundIP and with a polar structure reflective of the asymmet-ricdistributionoffinal-stateparticlesresultingfromtheasymmetric energy collision. From the innermost out,these subdetectors are the vertex detector (VXD), cen-tral drift chamber (CDC), electromagnetic calorimeter(ECL), and K-long and muon detector (KLM). In be-tweenCDCandECL,arecharged-particle-identificationsubdetectors: a time-of-propagation Cherenkov counter(TOP)inthebarrel,andanaerogelring-imagingCheren-kov detector (ARICH) in the forward region. BetweenECL and KLM, is a solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 Taxial magnetic field for measurements of the momentaand electric charge of charged particles. The vertex de-tector consists of two layers of pixel sensors (PXD) sur-rounded by four layers of microstrip sensors (SVD) todetermine the positions of decaying particles with thetypical impact-parameter resolution of10 −15µm, re-sulting in20 −30µmtypical vertex resolution120 .

The relative charged-particle transverse momentum resolution is typically0.4%/pT [GeV/c]. The observed hadron identification120 The second pixel layer is currently incomplete, covering ap-proximately 15% of the azimuthal acceptance. Installation ofthe pixel detector will be completed in 2023.

efficiencies are typically 90% at 10% contamination.
Typical uncertainties in hadron-identification perfor-manceare1%.TheCsI(Tl)-crystalelectromagneticcalorime-ter measures the energies of electrons and photons withenergy-dependent resolutions in the 1.6-4% range. Lay-ers of plastic scintillators and resistive-plate chambersinterspersed between the magnetic flux-return yoke’siron plates allow us to identify KL0 and muons. Ourobserved lepton-identification performance shows 0.5%pion contamination at 90% electron efficiency, and 7%kaon contamination at 90% muon efficiency. Typicaluncertainties in lepton-identification performance are1% −2%.
The Belle II experiment has unique advantages overhadron-collider experiments, such as the LHCb experi-ment. Despite having comparatively less data and feweraccessible initial states;– It produces heavy flavor particles in a less back-ground environment, which enables efficient detec-tion of neutral particles, such asγ, π0, K0S, K0L.
– It produces quantum correlated B0-¯B0 pairs, bywhich we can tag theB meson flavor with high ef-fective efficiency. We can also measure preciselyBdecay modes with neutrinos in the final state, byfully reconstructing one of theB mesons, referredto as “full reconstruction tagging”.
– It provides a large sample of τ leptons obtained,whichallowsustostudyindetailthepropertyoftheτ lepton, including Lepton-Flavor-Violating (LFV)decays.
As for the full reconstruction tagging, a new “FullEvent Interpretation (FEI)” tool has been developed[4659]. The basic idea of FEI is to reconstruct, in ahierarchical manner, individual particle decay channelsthat occur in the decay chain of theB meson. For eachunique decay channel of a particle, a multivariate clas-sifier (MVC) is trained using simulated events. Bothhadronic and semileptonicBdecays are used. The typi-caltag-sideefficiency,definedasthenumberofcorrectly550 14 THE FUTUREFig. 14.7.3 The unitarity triangle.
reconstructed tag-side B mesons divided by the totalnumber ofΥ(4S) events, is 0.61% (0.34%) for hadronicB+ (B0) decays and 1.45%(1.25%) for semileptonicB+(B0) decays. The full reconstruction tagging providesunique methods to measureB decays with neutrinos inthe final states, such asB →πℓν, B →D(∗)τν andB →Kν¯ν.
14.7.2 Precision CKM measurementsIn the Standard Model (SM),CP violation in theK/Bmeson decays can occur as the complex phase in theCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM)quarkmixingma-trix [3957, 3958]. The high luminosity data at Belle IIenable precision measurements of the three internal an-gles, (φ1,φ2,φ3) ≡(α,β,γ ), and the three sides of theunitarity triangle, which represents the unitarity con-dition of the CKM matrix elements,V∗udVub+ V∗cdVcb+V∗tdVtb = 0 , in the complex plane with the three termsdivided byVcdV∗cb, as shown in Figure14.7.3.
Measurement of φ1The internal angle φ1 ≡ arg(−VcdV∗cb/VtdV∗tb) is de-termined from measurements of time-dependent CPasymmetries, which occures via interference betweenBd − ¯Bd oscillation and b → c¯cs decay amplitudes.
Most of the hadronic uncertainties cancel out in theCP asymmetry, therefore, these measurements providevery clean and precise determinations ofφ1. In the ex-periment, after theB0 −¯B0 system is coherently pro-duced from anΥ(4S) decay, one of the B mesons,BCP,decays to aCP eigenstate fCP at t= tCP whereas theother, Btag, may decay to favor specific final state att= ttag. The distribution of the proper-time difference∆t≡tCP −ttag is expressed byPfCP(∆t,q) = e−|∆t|/τB04τB0{1 + q[AfCP cos(∆md∆t)+ SfCP sin(∆md∆t)]} ,(14.7.1)where τB0 and ∆md are the average lifetime and massdifference between neutral B physical states, respec-tively, andAfCP and SfCP are the direct and mixing-induced CP-violating asymmetries, respectively. The Bmesonflavorqtakesvalues +1(−1) whenBtag isB0( ¯B0)and it is statistically determined from the favor taggingalgorithm based on final-state information [4660]. Thetime-difference ∆tis approximated by the distance be-tween the two B-meson decay vertices divided by thespeed of theΥ(4S) projected onto the boost axis.
The previous experiments Belle, BaBar, and LHCbachieved determination ofφ1 at 2.4% precision [4661],using tree dominated(c¯c)K0 decays, such asJ/ψK0S,ψ(2S)K0S,χc1K0S and J/ψK0L. The error is still domi-nated by systematic uncertainties, associated with im-perfections in vertex reconstruction and flavor tagging.
The precision is expected to further improve to below1% in the next decade, and it will provide a firm basisto search for non-SM contributions.
Measurement of φ2Studies ofb→ucharmlessBdecays give access toφ2 ≡arg[−V∗tbVtd/V∗ubVud],theleastknownangleoftheCKMunitarity triangle, and probe non-SM contributions inprocessesmediatedbyloopdecay-amplitudes.However,clean extraction of φ2 is not trivial due to hadronicuncertainties, which are hardly tractable in perturba-tivecalculations.Appropriatecombinationsofmeasure-ments from decays related by flavor (isospin) symme-triesreducetheimpact ofsuchuncertainties[ 4662].Themost promising determination ofφ2 relies on the com-bined analysis of the decaysB+ →ρ+ρ0, B0 →ρ+ρ−,B0 →ρ0ρ0, and corresponding decay into pions. Thecurrent global precision of 4 degrees is dominated byB → ρρ data [4661]. Leveraging efficient reconstruc-tionoflow-energy π0,improvedmeasurementsin B+ →ρ+ρ0 and B0 →ρ+ρ− decays will be unique to Belle II.
The expected experimental accuracy for theφ2 deter-mination is less than1◦ at 50ab−1.
Measurement of φ3The third internal angleφ3 ≡arg[−VudV∗ub/VcdV∗cb] isaccessibleviatree-leveldecays,suchas B →DK,whereD represents a generic superposition of D0 and D0.
Assuming that non-SM amplitudes do not affect appre-ciably tree-level processes, precise measurements ofφ3and |Vub/Vcb|set strong constraints on the SM descrip-tion of CP violation, to be compared with measure-ments from higher-order processes potentially sensitiveto non-SM amplitudes, such as mixing-inducedCP vi-olation throughsin 2φ1. Extraction ofφ3 involves mea-surement of B− →D0K− and B− →D0K− ampli-14.7 BELLE II 551tudes, which are expressed asA(B− →D0K−)A(B− →D0K−) = rBei(δB−φ3), (14.7.2)where rB ≈0.1 is the ratio of amplitude magnitudesandδB isthestrong-phasedifference.Sincethehadronicparameters, rB and δB can be determined from data to-gether withφ3, these measurements are essentially freeof theoretical uncertainties [4663]. The precision ofφ3is mostly limited by the small branching fractions ofthe decays involved (around10−7). The current worldaverage isφ3 = (66.2+3.4−3.6)◦ [4661], whereas the indirectdetermination is(63.4 ±0.9)◦ [4080]. Various methodswith different choices of final states accessible to bothD0 and D0have been proposed to extract φ3. Theyinclude CP-eigenstates (GLW method) [4664, 4665],Cabibbo-favoured(CF)anddoubly-Cabibbo-suppressed(DCS)decays(ADSmethod)[ 4666],self-conjugatemodes(BPGGSZ method) [4667–4669], and singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) decays (GLS method) [4670].
Currently, precision is dominated by measurementsbased on B− → D(K0Sπ+π−)K− as well as B− →D(K0Lπ+π−)K− decays [4667–4669]. Belle II will becompetitive in this mode and others involving final-stateK0S,π0,and γsuchas K0Sπ0,K0Sπ+π−π0 orB− →D∗(D(γ,π0))h−. Precision will further improve follow-ing the expected three-fold improvements on the ex-ternal charm-strong-phase inputs from BESIII [4658].
In addition,B− →D(K0Sπ+π−π0)K− is promising atBelle II due to its sizable branching fraction and richresonance substructures, as shown by Belle [4671]. Im-provedcharm-strong-phaseinputs,availabilityofasuit-able amplitude model ofD→K0Sπ+π−π0 and a largerB decay sample will renderB− →D(K0Sπ+π−π0)K−a strong contributor for determination ofφ3. The pre-cision ofφ3 is expected to beO(1◦) with the full 50−1data set.
Determination of |Vcb|and |Vub|The magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements|Vcb|and|Vub|can be deduced from treeb →c and b →u pro-cesses and provide reliable SM references to test non-SM contributions. The most precise determinations of|Vcb|and |Vub|come from measurements of semileptonictransitions b→clν and b→ulν, either in inclusive orexclusive final states, combined with theoretical inputsto characterize the QCD effects associated withB de-cays. There has been significant disagreement in theresults obtained from exclusive and inclusive measure-ments [4661]. The reason for this discrepancy is un-known and has been a long-standing issue. It can bepossiblyinconsistentexperimentalortheoryinputs,butalso interpretations in terms of non-SM physics cannotbe excluded [4015]. The large data set at Belle II will of-fer more precise and richer experimental information totest theoretical investigations and to clarify the issue.
Exclusive |Vub|:Belle-II will provide a variety of ways for exclusive|Vub|determinations. While B0→π+ℓ−¯νℓ is currently themost effective in terms of availability of experimentaldata and theoretical calculations of the form factor,Belle II will also measure other exclusive b → uℓνℓmodes with good precision, in particular those involv-ing neutral final-state particles such asB− →(π0,ρ0,ω,η,η ′)ℓ−νℓand B0→ρ+ℓ−νℓ. The excellent resolution in q2 ≡(pℓ + pν)2 also gives access to the decay form factorsequally important for determining|Vub|. Typically, ex-perimental uncertainties are smallest for lowq2 whereasuncertainties in the form factors from lattice QCD aresmallest at high q2. Improvements in the experimen-tal constraints will be driven mainly by data set sizes.
Belle II can also measure the variety of exclusive decayswith high purities in analyses, where the (non-signal)partner B-meson is reconstructed [4672]. Belle II willdouble the global precision in exclusive|Vub|results be-low 3%. Expected progress in lattice QCD [4658] willoffer further significant improvement.
Inclusive |Vub|:Belle II will provide a unique opportunity to measureinclusive B →Xuℓν decays, where Xu is a charmlesshadronic system. Taking advantage of theBB thresh-old experiment, after reconstructing a signal lepton andthe partnerB meson, all remaining tracks and energyclusters can be associated with theXu candidate. Mea-surements require accurate modeling of theb→u sig-nal and the b → c background as demonstrated inthe latest Belle measurement of B → Xuℓν, whichindeed reports results closer to exclusive [4042]. Withlarger sample sizes and continuing developments in re-construction algorithms (e.g., improved partnerB re-construction), Belle II will accomplish measurements ofinclusive |Vub|to O(1)% precision. Belle II can also ex-plore novel ideas of measurements, such as the measure-ment of differential branching fractions ofB →Xuℓνwhichenablesshape-functionmodel-independentdeter-minations of|Vub|as demonstrated by Ref. [4045, 4046,4673].
Determination of |Vcb|:Belle II will be able to improve also determinations of|Vcb|from exclusive B →D(∗)ℓν decays and inclusive552 14 THE FUTUREB →Xcℓν decays. For exclusive analyses, the key ex-perimental challenges will be to understand better thecomposition and form factors ofB →D∗∗ℓνdecays andreduce relevant systematic uncertainties as those asso-ciated with lepton identification and low-momentum-pion reconstruction forB →D∗ℓν decays. Belle II willtackle this with a detailed program based on dedicatedauxiliary studies ofB →D∗∗ℓν decays. The precisionof inclusive determinations, which is limited by theory,will benefit from measurements of the kinematic mo-ments ofB →Xcℓν decays that will constrain hadronicmatrixelementsintheoperator-product-expansionbasedtheory. Ultimately Belle II will accomplish measure-ments of|Vcb|to O(1)% precision.
Summary of CKM measurementsFigure 14.7.4 presents the improvements of the CKMmeasurements,currentlyachievedandexpectedatBelleII. The CKMFitter group has performed analyses ofnon-SM physics in mixing, assuming that tree decaysare not affected by non-SM effects. Within this frame-work, non-SM contributions to theBd mixing ampli-tudes can be parametrized asMd12 = (Md12)SM ×(1 + hde2iσd) (14.7.3)Here hd and σd stand for the amplitude and phase ofthe non-SM physics, which are related to the mass-scaleparameter Λ viah≃|Cij|2|λtij|2(4.5 TeVΛ)(14.7.4)σ = arg( Cijλt∗ij), (14.7.5)where λtij = V∗tiVtj and V is the CKM matrix. Thescales Λprobed inBd mixing by the end of the Belle IIdata-taking will be 17TeV and 1.4TeV for CKMI-likecouplings in a tree and one-loop-level non-SM interac-tions respectively. For a scenario with no hierarchy, i.e.
|Cij|= 1 , the corresponding scale of operators probedwill be 2 ×103 TeV and 2 ×102 TeV in a tree- andone-loop-level non-SM interactions respectively.
14.7.3 Search for non-SM CP violation in rare BprocessesIn order to search for the non-SM contribution, themost promising channel is B0 →η′K0S; it has a siz-able decay rate dominated by theb →s loop ampli-tude, where non-SM physics can contribute, and its as-sociated hadronic uncertainties is relatively small. Thequantityofinterestis ∆Sη′K0S≡Sη′K0S−sin φ1.TheSMpredictions that include a systematic treatment of low-energy QCD amplitudes assuming factorization yieldFig. 14.7.4 Current unitarity triangle fit (top) and extrapo-lated to 50 ab−1 (bottom) [4658].
0.00 < ∆Sη′K0S<0.03 [4674]. The current world aver-age of∆Sη′K0Sis −0.07±0.06 [4661]. Low backgroundsand a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter of-fer Belle II unique access to this measurement. Simi-larly promising is the channel B0 →φK0S, whose fi-nal state makes Belle II strongly competitive despitechallengesassociatedwithmodel-relatedsystematicun-certainties from the Dalitz plot analysis. The expectedexperimental accuracy at 50ab−1 is ∼0.01(∼0.02)%for Sη′K0S(SφK0S). Figure14.7.5 demonstrates the time-dependent CP asymmetry for the final stateη′K0S com-pared to J/ψK0S, using Sη′KS0 = 0 .55 and SJ/ψK0S=0.70 in a Monte Carlo simulation with the integratedluminosity of 50 ab−1, where the two values would beunambiguously distinguishable, signifying the existenceofnewphysics.Inaddition,theprocesses B0 →K0Sπ0γ,B0 →K0Sπ+π−γ, and B0 →ρ0γ are greatly sensitiveto non-SM physics throughb→sand b→dloops andoffer Belle II further exclusive opportunities.
14.7.4 Search for non-SM physics in semileptonicand radiative B decaysA number of persistent anomalies have been observedin semileptonicBmeson decays; deviation from lepton-flavor universality in the decaysB →D(∗)τντ consis-tentlystayedatthe 3σlevelsincethesedecayswerefirstmeasured [4661]. Another case of lepton-flavor univer-sality violation has been seen inB →K(∗)ℓ+ℓ−. Theunique capability of Belle II to reconstruct final stateswith missing energy and identify efficiently all speciesof leptons will considerably improve the understandingof these anomalies.14.7 BELLE II 553Fig. 14.7.5 Time-dependent CP asymmetry for the finalstate η′K0S compared to J/ψK0S, using Sη′ K0S= 0 .55 andSJ/ψK0S= 0 .70 in a Monte Carlo simulation with the inte-grated luminosity of 50 ab−1 [4658].
Semitauonic B decaysDecays B →D(∗)τντ offer precious opportunities fortestinglepton-flavoruniversalityathighprecisionopen-ing a window onto lower-mass (TeV range) non-SMparticles. Sensitive observables are the ratioR(D) andR(D∗) of branching fractions ofB →D(∗)τντ to thoseof B →D(∗)ℓνℓ decays, whereℓ = e or µ. There havebeen numerous SM calculations ofR(D(∗)) and experi-mentally, the ratio allows for numerous systematic un-certainties to cancel. The SM predictions for the ratiosR(D) and R(D∗) are:R(D) = 0 .299 ±0.011 (14.7.6)R(D∗) = 0 .252 ±0.003 (14.7.7)Current best results on R(D(∗)) are reported by theBelle experiment [4675] and are consistent with previ-ous measurements [4676–4680] in showing a (combined)3.1σ excess with respect to the SM expectation [4661].
R(D) = 0 .349 ±0.027(stat) ±0.015(syst) (14.7.8)R(D∗) = 0 .298 ±0.011(stat) ±0.007(syst) (14.7.9)This deviation has attracted significant interest in thecommunity as it could be a potential indication of non-SM dynamics.
The main experimental challenge is achieving a de-tailedunderstandingofpoorlyknown B →D∗∗ℓνback-grounds, whose feed-down may bias the results. Theanticipated data set size will allow for accurate taggedmeasurements of B →D∗∗ℓν decays for several D∗∗states using samples reconstructing on the signal-side alepton, aD(∗) meson andn pions. If a non-SM sourceof the anomaly would be established, angle-dependentasymmetries and differences between forward-backwardasymmetries observed in muons and electrons, whichFig. 14.7.6 Expected Belle II constraints on the R(D) −R(D∗) plane (top) and theR(D∗) − Pτ(D∗) plane (bottom)compared to existing experimental constraints from Belle. TheSM predictions are indicated by the black points with theoret-ical error bars [4658].
are ideally suited for Belle II, may offer insight into theproperties of the non-SM couplings involved.
Measurements of polarization of theτ lepton ((Γ+−Γ−)/(Γ+ + Γ−)) andD∗ mesons (ΓL/(ΓT + ΓL)) pro-videsupplementarysensitivitytonon-SMphysics.Here,Γ+(Γ−) is the semitauonic decay rate where theτ has+12 (−12 ) helicity andΓL(ΓT) is the rate where theD∗haslongitudinal(transverse)polarization.Figure 14.7.6shows the expected Belle II constraints on theR(D) −R(D∗) plane (top) and theR(D∗)−Pτ(D∗) plane (bot-tom). Furthermore, differential angular distributions inB →D(∗)τν, usually studied as functions ofq2, mayalso be important to decipher the dynamics and aredistinctive to Belle II.
B →K∗ℓ+ℓ− decaysThe transitionsb→sµµ and b→see are under exten-sive experimental investigation due to several observedanomalies [4681–4685] that prompted interpretations interms ofO(10) TeV non-SM particles. The unique fea-ture of Belle II is its high efficiency and similar perfor-mance for muons and electrons, along with access toabsolute branching fractions. Based on a recent Belle554 14 THE FUTUREII analysis [4686], we expect to provide distinctive in-formation to assess independently the existence of theanomalies (at current central values) with samples of5 ab−1 to 10 ab−1 of data. Belle II can provide alsoresults based on inclusiveB →XSℓ+ℓ− decays, whichdo not specify the final strange hadronic statesXS andhas fewer theoretical ambiguities.
Belle II can reach alsob →sττ transitions. Thesecan be enhanced, by up to three orders of magnitude, inseveral SM extensions that allow for lepton-flavor uni-versality violation in the third generation [4687, 4688].
The SM branching fraction for theB →K∗ττ decay isaround 10−7 [4689], much smaller than current exper-imental upper limits, which are at around2.0 ×10−3at 90% CL [4690, 4691]. The presence of twoτ leptonsin the final state makes access to these decays ideallysuited to Belle II.
Radiative B decaysRadiative b →sγ transitions are dominated by a one-loop amplitude involving at quark andW boson. Ex-tensions of the SM predict particles that can contributetotheloop,potentiallyalteringvariousobservablesfromtheir SM predictions [4692, 4693]. Belle II has a uniquecapability to study these transitions both inclusivelyand using specific channels.
The availability of precise and reliable SM predic-tions of inclusiveB →XSγ rates, where Xs identifiesa particle with strangeness, make these rates sensitiveprobes for non-SM physics. In addition, these analysesenable the determination of observables like theb-quarkmass and can provide input to inclusive determinationsof |Vub|[4658]. Ability to measure precisely the decayproperties of the partnerB recoiling against the signalB is key for inclusive analyses[4659]. Current best re-sults show 10% fractional precision mostly limited bysystematic uncertainties associated with understandingthe large backgrounds. The expected relative uncertain-ties on the branching fractions are∼6% at 5 ab−1 and∼2% at 50 ab−1 slightly depending on the lowerEγthereshold. The construction of relative quantities likeasymmetries will offer a further reduction of systematicuncertainties and enhanced reach. Inclusive analyses ofradiative B decays will offer unique windows over non-SM physics throughout the next decade.
14.7.5 Hadron SpectroscopyWhile many hadron states are categorized into mesonsandbaryonscontainingconstituentquark-antiquark( q¯q)and three quarks (qqq), respectively, there is no proofin QCD to exclude the hadrons having other struc-tures than the ordinary mesons and baryons. The sit-uation has largely changed by the series of discover-ies of charmonium-like states,X(3872) [2460], Yc(4260)[4694], Z±c (3900) [2534], and several others that do notfit the well-established quark model. Analogous dis-coveries containing bottom quarks (e.g., Υ(5S) decaysto Z±b (10610/50) [2544]) indicate a similar unexploredfamilyofparticlesinthebottomoniumsector.TheBelleIIexperiment offers several unique opportunities in thisdomain. It will exploit 40 times more data than the pre-viousgeneration B-factoriesand,comparedwithhadron-collisions experiments, leverages a greater variety ofquarkonium production mechanisms including B me-son decays, initial state radiation (ISR), doubleccpro-cesses, two-photon processes, and direct production bychanging collider center-of-mass energy [4658]. Belle IIis the only experiment with the ability to operate attuneable center-of-mass energy near the Υ(4S) reso-nance,providingdirectaccesstomulti-quarkstatescon-taining bottom quarks. In addition, Belle II’s good ef-ficiency for reconstructing neutral final-state particlesopensthepathwayforfirstobservationsofthepredictedneutral partners of charged tetraquark states.
Belle II has the unique opportunity to explorebottomonium(-like) states by operating at center-of-mass energies around 10 GeV, where only small sam-ples exist worldwide:O(10) fb−1 at Υ(1S,2S,3S,6S),O(100) fb−1 at Υ(5S), and typically less than 1 fb−1 atintermediate points. This opens a fruitful program, asdemonstrated by previous discoveries ate+e− collidersthat yielded first observations of predicted bottomonia(ηb(1S,2S), hb(1P,2P), and Υ(1D2)) and unexpectedfour-quark states (Z±b (10610,10650), Yb(10753)) [4695,4696]. Collisions at energies below theΥ(4S) allow fortesting non-SM predictions inΥ decays to invisible orlepton-flavor-violating final states [4697, 4698].
14.7.6 Constraining hadronic vacuum-polarizationin muon g-2The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon oftenparametrized as aµ = ( g −2)µ/2, is one of the ob-servables which indicate significant deviation from theSM and has attracted much attention from the com-munity. The current experimental value (combining theBNL E821 result with the first result from the Fermi-lab g−2 experiment) differs from SM predictions basedon dispersion relations by4.2σ, aµ(exp)−aµ(theory) =(26.0 ±7.9) ×10−10 [4206, 4207]. In order to clarifythe deviation, it is important to improve the precisionof both experiments and the SM predictions. On theexperimental side, the experiment at Fermilab will pro-vide results by further accumulated data and also anexperiment with different methods and thus have dif-14.8 Heavy flavors at the HL-LHC 555ferent systematic errors has been proposed and is beingprepared at J-PARC [4699]. The uncertainty in the SMprediction is dominated by the leading-order hadroniccontribution (HVP), which can be calculated from thecross-section σ(e+e− → hadrons) measured in e+e−experiments. The result, HVP=(693.1 ±4.0) ×10−10,is dominated by BaBar and KLOE measurements ofσ(e+e− → π+π−). However, the BaBar and KLOEmeasurements notably differ. This difference introducesa systematic uncertainty of2.8 ×10−10 [4224].
BelleIIwillperformthesemeasurementswithlargerdata sets, and at least comparable systematic uncer-tainty, to resolve this discrepancy. Furthermore, largestatistics data at Belle II will allow us to use new ap-proaches to suppress systematic uncertainties, particu-larly from particle identification. Although the specificsystematic studies still need to be refined, the goal forthe final accuracy including both statistical and sys-tematic uncertainties is to be 0.5% or lower [ 4658].
This will match the expected experimental precisionon g−2[4206, 4658]. Belle II’s operation at the high-est luminosity e+e− collider, as well as its excellentparticle-identification capabilities, places it in a uniqueposition to further the studies of the HVP contribu-tion to (g−2)µ in the next decade. HVP can be esti-mated also byτ hadronic spectral functions and CVC,together with isospin-breaking corrections.
14.7.7 Status and outlookThe physics data taking with all the Belle II subdetec-tor components started in March 2019, following theSuperKEKB main ring commissioning run in 2016, andthe collision test runs in 2018. At the time when this ar-ticleiswritten,theSuperKEKBacceleratorhasachievedthe peak luminosity of4.7 ×1034 cm−2s−1, more thantwo times higher than the record of the previous KEKBaccelerator. The Belle II experiment has accumulated428 fb−1, almost similar to the BaBar and about half ofthe Belle experiments. Some results are already world-leading thanks to the efficiency and resolution improvedsignificantlycomparedtothepreviousexperiments.Theoperation is suspended since June 2022 for the upgradework on the SuperKEKB and Belle II instrumentations.
The operation is planned to resume in autumn 2023.
Many world-leading results in heavy flavor decays willbe obtained with O(1) ab−1 data in the near future,and then withO(10) ab−1 toward the next decade.
14.8 Heavy flavors at the HL-LHCTim GershonProton-proton collisions at energies of the LHC col-lider result in production of vast quantities of beautyand charm quarks. The production cross-sections atcentre-of-mass collision energies of7–14 TeV are around100 µb for beauty hadrons and an order of magnitudelarger for charm hadrons [4700, 4701]. Thus, for eachfb−1 of integrated luminosity, there are around 1011beauty hadrons and around1012 charm hadrons pro-duced. As there are no constraints on the quantumnumbers of the particles that emerge from the primaryinteractionfollowedbyhadronization,essentiallyallphys-ically possible hadrons are produced in LHC collisions.
Sinceeffectsofdoublepartonscattering,wheremultipleheavy quark-antiquark pairs are produced in the sameproton-proton interaction, are significant, this includesstates with more than one heavy-flavor quark.
The LHC and its high luminosity upgrade there-fore provide a unique and unprecedented opportunityto learn about QCD from the production and decays ofthese hadrons. However, in order for this experimentalprogram to be realized, it is necessary to have dedicatedand state-of-the-art detection capability. In particular,focusing on charged particle detection, one needs:– acceptance, with good reconstruction efficiency, inthe kinematic region that the majority of the decayproducts will travel through (production of beautyand charm hadrons at the LHC predominantly oc-curs at small angles to the beam axis);– good momentum resolution, so that narrow signalpeaksininvariantmassdistributionsoriginatingfromstates close to each other in mass to be resolved;– capability to discriminate between different final-state charged particles, in particular electrons, pi-ons, muons, kaons and protons;– ability to reject background from random combina-tions of particles, which must be achieved in real-time (online) in order to avoid the data rate over-whelming the available computing resources.
As regards the last point, the presence of one or morewell-identified muons in the decay, above apT thresholdof typically a few GeV/c, is a signature which has tradi-tionally been used in triggers for heavy-flavor physics inhadron collider experiments. This signature continuesto be exploited at the LHC, and will be throughout theHL-LHC era. However, the fact that the ground-statehadrons with heavy-flavor quantum numbers can onlydecay by the weak interaction provides an extremelyvaluable handle, as their non-negligible lifetimes causea significant — and potentially measurable – displace-556 14 THE FUTUREFig. 14.8.1 The proposed LHCb Upgrade II detector [4702].
ment between the production and decay vertices. Con-sider for example a state of mass5 GeV/c2 and lifetimeτ = 1 ps . If produced with50 GeV/c momentum, cor-responding to a Lorentz boost factor of βγ = 10 , itwill travel a mean distance ofβγcτ ≈3 mm before de-caying. Therefore if the vertex position can be recon-structed with resolution significantly better than this,the potentially huge background from combinations ofthe large numbers of tracks produced at the primaryproton-proton interaction point can be removed. In-deed, while proton-proton collisions are generally con-sidered a difficult (or “dirty”) environment due to thelargenumbersofparticlesproduced,ifoneonlyneedstoconsider particles originating from displaced secondaryvertices the signatures can be extremely clean.
The LHCb detector is designed in order to pro-vide this detection capability. It is the only dedicatedheavy-flavor experiment at the LHC, although ALICE,ATLAS and CMS all have some ability to reconstructheavy-flavor hadrons. The original LHCb detector op-erated during Runs 1 and 2 of the LHC, 2011–12 and2015–18 respectively, enabling the collection of a datasample corresponding to 9 fb−1 of proton-proton col-lisions. This has led to a wealth of publications on adiverse range of topics. An upgraded detector has beeninstalled during the LHC long shutdown 2 (2019 - 21)and is designed for the collection of a sample of50 fb−1during Runs 3 and 4, with significantly improved effi-ciencies for many channels of interest. In order to ex-ploit fully the flavor-physics potential of the HL-LHC,a second major upgrade of the LHCb detector is nowbeing planned [4702]; this will allow300 fb−1 to be col-lected in the final operational periods of the HL-LHC.
Together with the3 ab−1 anticipated to be collected byATLAS and CMS, this provides exciting potential inheavy-flavor physics.
The above discussion focussed on charged particles.
For neutral particles it is much harder both to ob-tain good momentum resolution and to associate themcorrectly to the vertex they originated from, particu-larly bearing in mind that they will be reconstructed inthe forward kinematic region. Nonetheless, informationfrom calorimeters can be used to broaden the flavor-physics program to include decays with photons in thefinal state, including those from neutral pion decaysand from bremstrahlung emission from electrons. More-over, timing information can be used to provide somecapability to associate calorimeter clusters with recon-structed vertices; indeed the addition of timing capabil-ity is central to the plans for LHCb Upgrade II, not onlyfor the calorimeter but also for the vertex and chargedhadron identification detectors [4702].
The opportunities in flavor physics at the HL-LHCare discussed in Ref. [4703], while the LHCb Upgrade IIphysics program is described in Ref. [2579]. Here only abriefsummaryofsomeaspectsthataremostinterestingwith regard to QCD are discussed. The focus is primar-ily on LHCb, but areas where other LHC experimentscan contribute are also mentioned.
CP violationViolation of symmetry under the combined charge con-jugation and parity (CP) operation can occur in theStandard Model as the complex phase in the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa(CKM)quarkmixingmatrix[ 3957,3958] results in the charged-current weak-interactioncoupling constants being different for quarks and anti-quarks. The uniqueness of the origin of allCP violatingeffects in the SM – and the knowledge that additionalsourcesmustbepresentinnatureinordertoexplainthebaryon asymmetry of the Universe – make experimen-tal probes ofCP-violating phenomena a well-motivatedway to search for physics beyond the SM.
There are a number of theoretically clean probes ofCP violation, where QCD effects that may otherwiserender the interpretation of results difficult are eitherminimal or can be determined directly from data. Inparticular, the determination of the phaseγ ≡arg(−VudV∗ubVcdV∗cb)from B →DK and similar processes is essentially un-affected by theoretical uncertainties in the SM [4663].
However,therearemanymoremeasurementswhereun-certainties related to QCD need to be reduced in orderto obtain the best sensitivity to physics beyond the SM.
An interesting class of such measurements are thosewhere decays can be related by flavor symmetries, asthe breaking of this symmetry by QCD can often be14.8 Heavy flavors at the HL-LHC 557calculated theoretically. The fact that bothB0 and B0smesons can be studied at the LHC opens a numberof possibilities involving U-spin symmetry, related tointerchange ofd and s quarks. For example, the deter-mination of the phase2β ≡2 arg(−VcdV∗cbVtdV∗tb)from B0 → J/ψK0S decays has a small but hard-to-quantify uncertainty due to subleading amplitudes; thesize of this effect can be constrained using the U-spinpartner B0s →J/ψK0S decays [4704, 4705]. In a similarway, theB0s →K∗0K∗0 decay is considered a goldenchannel to probe for CP-violation effects beyond theSM,astheoreticaluncertaintiescanbeconstrainedfromthe U-spin partnerB0 →K∗0K∗0 decay [4706–4708].
The above examples are special cases where the fi-nal state is left unchanged by U-spin. Similar ideas canbe also exploited for U-spin pairs where this is notthe case, such as B0 → D+D− ↔ B0s → D+s D−s ,B0 →π+π− ↔B0s →K+K− and B0 →K+π− ↔B0s →K−π+ [4709–4714]. In these cases however theU-spin breaking effects can be larger, making it harderto use them for precise tests of the SM. However, withthe data samples available at the HL-LHC it will bepossible to reverse the argument: assuming the SM, theextent of U-spin breaking in these decays can be pre-cisely measured and compared to theoretical calcula-tions. Moreover, the samples will be large enough thatsimilarexercisescanalsobedoneforsuppressedpartnerdecays (e.g. B0 →D+s D−s ↔B0s →D+D− and B0 →K+K− ↔B0s →π+π−) where effects of subleadingamplitudes are enhanced. Studies of U-spin breakingand its influence onCP violation in the charm mesondecays D0 →K+K−, π+π−, K−π+ and K+π− pro-vide a complementary probe [4715–4718]. These mea-surements will provide a unique handle on our under-standing of flavor symmetry breaking effects in QCD.
A number of null tests of the SM can be madeby testing the prediction of small or vanishing CP-violating effects in specific processes. In such cases itis necessary to ensure that theoretical uncertainties inthe prediction are well under control. One example isthe determination of the phaseφs through B0s →J/ψφand similar processes, where LHCb, ATLAS and CMSall have potential to reach sufficient precision to ob-serve a non-zero effect at the SM rate [4719–4721]. An-other example is the corresponding phase in the neutralcharm system,φD, where recent progress measuring themixing parameters has set the stage for precise deter-minations when more data are available [4722, 4723].
It remains an open question to what extent QCD ef-fects can enhance SMCP violation in the charm sector[4724], and further progress on this front will be essen-tial.
Data on two-body decays are in general easier tointerpret than those in three- or multi-body decays (in-cluding quasi-two-body resonant contributions). Never-theless, the latter remain of great interest as interfer-ence effects can provide sensitivity to additionalCP-violating observables: the range of effects observed inthree-body Bmesondecaysillustratethisclearly[ 4725–4729]. Overcoming hadronic uncertainties is challeng-ing, but with HL-LHC data ambitious coupled-channelanalyses will allow additional constraints. In particu-lar, effects related to ππ ↔ KK scattering can befitted for directly in coupled-channel analyses of B0and (separately or simultaneously) B0s decays to theJ/ψπ+π− and J/ψK+K− final states [4730]. Similaranalyses can also be carried out inB0(s) →D0π+π−and D0K+K− decays, and in B+ → K+π+π− andK+K+K− decays. The latter, and also the more sup-pressed B+ → π+π+π− and π+K+K− decays, areknown to feature regions of phase space with largeCPviolation, which could be used to test the SM if theo-retical uncertainties can be controlled sufficiently.
As mentioned above, the CKM angleγ can be de-termined with negligible uncertainty usingB →DKand related decays. The reason for this is that by com-bining results with multiple differentD decay modes,all hadronic parameters can be determined from data.
Recent examples of such combinations can be foundin Refs. [4731, 4732]. From the point of view of under-standingQCD,thisprovidesanopportunitytocomparethevaluesofthehadronicparametersobtainedfromthecombinations to those from theoretical calculations. Inthe case of multibody decays such asB →DKπ, theparameters that can be obtained include those relatedto variation of hadronic phases across the phase-spaceof the decay [4733, 4734]. These can be determinedmodel-independently as a by-product of the measure-ment ofγ, thus providing insight into a poorly under-stand aspect of QCD.
Semileptonic decays and form factorsAs discussed in Sec.13.2.2, the rates of semileptonicb-hadron decays,Xb →Xcℓ−νℓ depend on the square ofthe magnitude of the CKM matrix elementVcb. Here,Xb represents a hadron containing ab quark, Xc thecorresponding hadron withb replaced by c, ℓ− a neg-atively charged lepton and νℓ the corresponding an-tineutrino. Thus, measurements of the rates can allow|Vcb|2 to be determined if the form factors, which en-code the probability for theXc hadron to be producedinthefinalstateasafunctionofthe ℓ−νℓ invariantmasssquared (q2), are known from theoretical calculations.558 14 THE FUTURELikewise, studies ofXb →Xuℓ−νℓ transitions, with ob-vious definition ofXu, provide sensitivity to|Vub|2.
The reconstruction of decays involving neutrinos inthe final state is challenging in the environment of ahadron collider, as one cannot exploit the kinematicconstraints that are available in thee+e− →Υ(4S) →BB system. Nonetheless, exploiting LHCb’s capabil-ity in reconstruction of vertices and charged hadronidentification, it has been possible to study semilep-tonic Λ0b (to pµ−νµ and Λ+c µ−νµ) andB0s (to K+µ−νµand D+s µ−νµ) decays [715, 4077]. In each case measur-ing the ratio allows the cancellation of some potentialsources of systematic uncertainty, leading to competi-tive measurements of|Vub/Vcb|2.
WiththefullHL-LHCstatisticsitwillbepossibletoextend this program to the full range ofbhadrons. Thiswill provide complementary information to the deter-minations usingB mesons alone, and will test QCD bycomparison of the form factors in heavy-to-light tran-sitions (such asB →π) with those in heavy-to-heavytransitions. A particularly interesting example occursin B−c decays, where study of B−c →D0µ−νµ couldpotentially allow a theoretically clean determination of|Vub|2. In fact, the large samples ofB−c mesons thatwill be available at HL-LHC present a further opportu-nity, since these particles preferentially decay throughtransitions of the charm quark. Thus,B−c →B0sµ−νµand B0µ−νµ decays could be used to make novel mea-surements of the squared magnitudes ofVcs and Vcd,respectively, thereby allowing a quantitative compar-ison of the form factors observed in data with thosecalculated from first principles QCD.
Understanding QCD effects encoded in form fac-tors and, more generally, the effects of hadronizationin semileptonic b-hadron decays, will also be crucialfor tests of lepton universality at HL-LHC. Within theStandard Model theW and Z couplings to all leptonflavors are identical; any deviation from this predictionwould provide a clear signature of non-SM physics con-tributing to the decay amplitude. Due to the heavierτ mass, compared to the electron and muon, contri-butions from different form factors have to be under-stood in order to predict the SM value of the ratio ofbranching fractions [4051–4053]. Given the indicationsof potential violation on lepton universality in previousmeasurements of these processes at the BaBar, Belleand LHCb experiments [4675–4680] there is intense in-terest in the significantly more precise results that theHL-LHC can potentially provide. The challenge will beto control experimental systematic uncertainties to therequired level; this is even harder for ATLAS and CMSthan for LHCb, but if the background composition canbe understood then all three experiments may be ableto test the SM in this sector.
Rare decaysDecays which proceed by flavor-changing neutral cur-rents are highly suppressed in the Standard Model asthey involve loop diagrams, typically with additionalCKM suppression factors. As physics beyond the SMdoes not have to have the same structure, the ratesand phase space distributions of these channels allowdetailed tests for new contributions to the amplitudes.
In order to obtain the best sensitivity from thesemeasurements, it is necessary to have QCD uncertain-ties, related to the hadrons in initial, intermediate andfinal states of the decay, under excellent control. Thus,typically the theoretically cleanest probes are decaysinvolving leptons or photons. However, even in thesecases there can be residual QCD effects that must bewell understood. Recent progress is therefore focussedmainly on theoretically clean channels and data-drivenapproaches to constrain hadronic parameters.
The purely leptonicB0(s) meson decays are a goodexample of channels where theoretically clean predic-tions are possible. Moreover, the helicity-suppressionof these processes that occurs in the SM — resultingin small branching fractions for the dimuon and, espe-cially, dielectron, processes — need not be replicatedin beyond SM contributions to the amplitudes, so thatlarge deviations from the SM predictions are possible inprinciple. The decay rates for these processes depend onthe B0(s) decay constants, which can be (and have been)calculated in lattice QCD to good precision [279]. Theexperimentally most amenable channel is the dimuon fi-nal state; theB0s →µ+µ− decay has been observed byLHCb, CMS and ATLAS, and the sensitivity to theB0decay branching fraction approaches the level requiredto observe it at the SM expectation [4735–4737]. Thelimits on decays to dielectron and ditau final states re-main considerably above the SM expectations [4738,4739].
Furtherimprovementintheknowledgeofthe B0(s) →µ+µ− branching fractions and their ratio is well moti-vated, as the experimental uncertainties remain largerthan those for theory. These measurements can be ex-pected as a key component of the HL-LHC era heavy-flavor physics programs of all of the LHCb, CMS andATLAS experiments: it is anticipated that relative un-certainties onB(B0s →µ+µ−)of 4%, 7% and 12–15%can be achieved by each of the three experiments, re-spectively [4702, 4740, 4741]. In addition, the increas-inglylargesamplesizeswillmakeadditionalprobespos-sible. In particular, theB0s →µ+µ− effective lifetimecan be used as an independent probe for physics be-14.8 Heavy flavors at the HL-LHC 559yond the SM [4742], with first measurements alreadyavailable, albeit with large uncertainties. With the fullHL-LHC statistics it will also be possible to measureCP violation parameters in this decay, providing onemore independent probe, also with negligible theoreti-cal uncertainty.
The b →sℓ+ℓ− and b →dℓ+ℓ− processes can alsobe studied through decays in which thes or d quarkis found in the final state. These do not have the he-licity suppression of the purely leptonic decays, but asa corollary have sensitivity to additional effective fieldtheory operators. A large range of final states and alarge number of observables can be studied. Those re-lated to angular distributions inB →Vℓ+ℓ− processesare particularly interesting (where V is a vector me-son, i.e. decays such asB0 →K∗0ℓ+ℓ−). In these mea-surements, all relevant operators can be constrainedfrom data. Indeed, as discussed in Sec.13.4, existingmeasurements of the rates and of angular observablesin B0 → K∗0µ+µ− and B0s → φµ+µ− decays con-strain possible contributions from physics beyond theSM and, excitingly, hint at these contributions beingnon-zero [4685, 4743–4746]. However, the possibility ofthese effects being caused by larger than expected non-perturbativeQCDcorrectionsisnotyetruledout[ 4190,4192].
Progress in this area, with the larger data samplesavailable at the HL-LHC, can be expected in two com-plementary approaches. Firstly, model-dependent fitsto the data can be used to attempt to constrain thenon-perturbative QCD effects within specific parame-terizations [4182, 4188, 4194, 4747]. Secondly, the SMproperty of lepton universality in these processes can betested – comparison of equivalent parameters for decaysinvolving µ+µ− and e+e− pairs provide theoreticallycleantestsoftheSM.WhilethesecondcasecanprovideanunambiguoussignalofphysicsbeyondtheSM,thisisonly possible if the new physics violates lepton univer-sality. Progress on both fronts is therefore essential inorder to be able to constrain the full range of potentialoperators.EarlymeasurementsfromLHCbof theratiosof decay rates forB+ →K+ℓ+ℓ− and B0 →K∗0ℓ+ℓ−(with ℓ = e,µ) give tantalizing hints of disagreementwith SM predictions, but do not reach a level of signif-icance for which strong claims would be justified [4682,4748].Inadditiontolargerdatasamples,improvedelec-tron reconstruction can help to reduce the uncertaintiesin future measurements. The range of lepton universal-ity tests can also be expected to be increased in futurebeyond the rates alone to include also angular observ-ables.
A further way to test the SM is through its predic-tion that the photon emitted inb→sγ flavor-changingneutral-currenttransitionsshouldbepredominantlyleft-handed, as a consequence of the V−A structure of theSM weak interaction. This can be tested in a num-ber of ways, including through studies of the decay-time dependence of B0 → K∗0γ and B0s → φγ de-cays, and of the angular distributions inΛ0b →Λγ de-cays [4749–4752]. The angular distribution of B0 →K∗0e+e− decays at very lowe+e− invariant mass alsoprobes the same physics [4753]. However, the statisti-cally most powerful approach involves analysis of thephase-space distribution of B+ →K+π+π−γ decays,complemented by measurement of the decay-time de-pendence of theB0 →K0Sπ+π−γ process [4754–4758].
To realise the full potential of this method will requireimproved understanding of hadronic effects in theKππsystem. The large data samples available at the HL-LHC will provide a number of ways to acquire suchknowledge, including measurement of the correspond-ing processes where the final-state photon is replacedby aJ/ψ meson.
Hadron spectroscopyAsmentionedpreviously,thecopiousproductionofbeautyandcharmquarksinLHCcollisionsprovidesopportuni-ties for detailed studies of hadron spectroscopy, includ-ingdiscoveriesofpreviouslyunmeasuredstates.Variousproduction mechanisms are available, including centralexclusive production. However, the two mechanisms forwhich studies have proved most productive to date areso-called prompt production, where a hadron is pro-duced directly in a proton-proton collision (includingvia strongly decaying resonances), and production inweak decays of a heavier hadron. Prompt decays tendto have large backgrounds, and are limited to cases witha distinctive signature – but they provide the only pos-sible approach for hadrons too heavy to be produced inweak decays. Weak decays of heavy hadrons can pro-vide an extremely clean environment; moreover this ap-proach makes possible determination of the quantumnumbers of intermediate resonances produced in multi-body final states.
At the time of writing, 67 hadrons have been ob-served for the first time at the LHC as illustrated inFig. 14.8.2. As discussed in Secs.8.5 and 9.4, these in-clude a number of states that do not fit into the con-ventional scheme ofqq mesons andqq′q′′ baryons. Oneof the most exciting topics, related to furthering knowl-edge of QCD, is what new hadrons may be discoveredat the HL-LHC. This is, of course, impossible to pre-dict with confidence; nonetheless there are certain ar-eas where progress appears likely. In what follows stateswith four and five quarks are referred to as tetraquarksand pentaquarks respectively, with no prejudice as to560 14 THE FUTUREtheir internal binding mechanisms – indeed, addressingthe question of how such states are bound is one ofthe main goals for the HL-LHC in this area – and thenaming convention of Ref. [2468] is used.
Perhapsthemoststrikingdiscoveryofexotichadronsto date is that of thePψ states, observed as resonancesdecaying toJ/ψp, and hence with minimal quark con-tent ccuud in Λ0b →J/ψpK− decays [2828, 2829]. Theproximity of thePψ masses toΣcD thresholds has ledto much speculation on their nature. Further progressrequires the determination of thePψ spin-parity quan-tum numbers. Discoveries of other production modesand decays to other final states will also provide in-sight. The data samples of the HL-LHC should allowLHCb to perform such studies, and also to make de-tailed studies of lineshapes.
The Pψ pentaquarks contain a cc pair, as do alltetraquarks that had been observed prior to 2020. Thisfueled theoretical speculation that acc component, orat least the presence of two heavy quarks or antiquarks,was necessary for the formation of exotic hadrons. Suchmodels were, however, ruled out by the observationof Tcs tetraquarks decaying to D+K−, produced inB− →D−D+K− decays [4760, 4761]. This observa-tion implies the existence of many more tetraquarks,containing different sets of quark flavors, which may bediscoverable with the HL-LHC. As such states are ob-served and can be arranged in families, it will allow fora new understanding of strong interactions in much thesame way as occurred for the “particle zoo” in the 1960sand 70s.
Even if acc component is not required for the for-mation of exotic hadrons, aJ/ψmeson in the final statefacilitates the observation of new particles due to thecleansignatureprovidedbythe J/ψdimuondecay.Thishas been exploited in the observations ofTψψ states de-caying toJ/ψJ/ψ [2565, 4762, 4763]. The discovery ofstates with minimal quark content of cc¯c¯c motivatessearches for partner states, including decays to finalstates such asJ/ψχc1, which may cause feed-down intothe J/ψJ/ψ spectrum, as well as for tetraquarks withother fully heavy-quark content (e.g. bbcc). Knowledgeof bottomonia decays to double charmonia final stateswill also be necessary for a full understanding in thisarea.
The first doubly charmed hadron, theΞ++cc state,was observed by LHCb in 2017 [2561], and precise mea-surements of its mass and lifetime have followed [2563,2564]. Its flavor partners, theΞ+cc and Ω+cc baryons havealso been searched for, but not yet discovered [2832,4764, 4765]. The reason for this may be the shorter life-times that are expected for these states, since a shortlifetime makes it harder to separate signal from back-ground.TheimprovedvertexresolutionoftheupgradedLHCb detector, together with larger data samples, willhence provide excellent prospects for discovery. Doublyheavy states containing beauty and charm quarks alsoappear within reach, while double beauty states appearmore challenging.
The discovery of theT+cc tetraquark, seen in promptproduction as a narrow structure decaying toD0D0π+[1071, 2512], complements both the previous observa-tions of theΞ++cc baryon and of tetraquarks withcccon-tent. Its mass is only just above threshold forD0D∗+decays, supporting the hypothesis that ground-state te-traquarkscontainingbeautyandcharmordoublebeauty(Tbc or Tbb), which are expected to be more tightlybound,maybestabletostrongdecays.Ifso,theywoulddecay only via the weak interaction and hence have life-times comparable to those of ground state beauty andcharm hadrons. As such, they may have displaced ver-tex signatures that could be exploited in the LHCb ex-periment to enhance their observability [4766]. It is alsopossible thatPcc, Pbc and Pbb pentaquarks could be de-tected, with the appropriate analysis strategy depend-ing on whether or not they are stable against strongdecay. Furthermore, it is plausible (albeit speculative)that six quark, dibaryon states containing at least twobeauty or charm quarks may be measurable. Studiesof hadron spectroscopy with the HL-LHC data samplemay therefore provide dramatic breakthroughs in theknowledge of the possible range of states that can bebound together within QCD.
14.9 High-pT physics at HL-LHCMassimiliano Grazzini andGudrun Heinrich14.9.1 IntroductionThe High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is scheduled tostart operation in 2029. By colliding protons with aninstantaneous luminosity that is five times higher thanwhat is achieved at the LHC, the HL-LHC is expectedto deliver data corresponding to an integrated luminos-ityof 3000 fb−1 bytheendofthe2030s,whichisafactorof 20 more than what has been collected so far. De-spite the highly challenging experimental environment,such an increased dataset – collected with upgradeddetectors – has an immense physics potential: it willgive access to the rarest phenomena, and will be crit-ical to reduce systematic uncertainties or bypass theirlimitations with new analyses, leading to measurementsof unprecedented precision.

14.9.2 Higgs propertiesThe study of Higgs boson (H) properties is central inthe HL-LHC physics programme. Since its discoveryin 2012, analyses related to the Higgs boson have sig-nificantly expanded, and have now turned into a vastcampaign of precision measurements, with fundamentalopportunities to indirectly constrain the Higgs bosonwidth and to access its trilinear coupling. Small devi-ations from the SM can be described in a consistentframework by using effective field theory (EFT).
The main measurements of Higgs boson propertiesare based on five production modes (gluon fusionggF,vector boson fusion VBF, associated production with aW or Z vector boson or with a top-quark pair) and fivedecay modes:H →γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, b¯b. TheH →µµand Zγ channels should become visible in the future.
The rate measurements in the production and decaychannels mentioned above yield measurements of theHiggs boson couplings in the so-called “κ-framework”[4767]. The latter introduces a set of scaling factorsκithat linearly modify the couplings of the Higgs bosonto the corresponding SM elementary particles, includ-ing the effective couplings to gluons and photons. Theprojected uncertainties, combining ATLAS and CMS,are summarized in Figure14.9.1. Note that theory un-certainties are assumed to be halved with respect totheir current values. Except for rare decays, the over-all uncertainties will be dominated by the theoreticalsystematics, with a precision close to the percent level.
These coupling measurements assume the absence ofsizable additional contributions toΓH. As observed inRef. [4769], the signal-background interference in theproduction of Z-boson pairs is sensitive toΓH. Mea-suringtheoff-shellfour-leptonfinalstatesandassumingthat the Higgs boson couplings can be extrapolated inthe off-shell region from their SM values, the HL-LHCwill extractΓH using this indirect measurement with a20% precision at68% CL [4768].
The production of Higgs boson pairs is a centralprocess to access the Higgs trilinear coupling. The Run2 experience in searches for Higgs boson pair produc-tion led to a reassessment of the HL-LHC sensitivity,including additional channels that were not consideredin previous projections. ATLAS and CMS anticipate asensitivity to theHH signal of approximately 3σ perexperiment, leading to a combined observation sensi-tivity of 4σ. These analyses lead to the combined likeli-hood profile as a function ofκλ shown in Figure14.9.2.
It should be noted that the upper limit on the signalstrength forHH production can reach the SM expecta-562 14 THE FUTURE00.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 Expected relative uncertaintyγZκµκτκbκtκgκZκWκγκ9.8 4.3 1.9 3.7 3.4 2.5 1.5 1.7 1.8 6.4 7.2 1.7 1.7 3.8 1.0 1.5 0.9 0.8 3.2 1.3 1.3 3.1 0.9 1.1 2.1 0.9 0.8 1.2 0.7 0.6 1.3 0.8 0.7 1.3 0.8 1.0 TotStat Exp Th Uncertainty [%]CMS and ATLASHL-LHC Projection per experiment-1 = 14 TeV, 3000 fbsTotalStatisticalExperimentalTheory2%4% Fig. 14.9.1 Projected uncertainties for the scaling parame-ters κi, combining ATLAS and CMS: total (grey box), statisti-cal (blue), experimental (green) and theory (red) uncertainties.

Elisabeth Brost, talk at Higgs10 meeting, CERN, July2022).
14.9.3 Multiple gauge bosonsThe study of multiple gauge boson production is ofcrucial importance to test the EW gauge symmetry,since it can signal the presence of anomalous gauge cou-plings [4770]. At HL-LHC, evidence for the productionof three gauge bosons can be obtained at the3σ levelin the WWZ and WZZ channels and at the5σ levelin the WWW channel considering the fully leptonicdecay modes [3874]. Following the first observation ofvector-boson scattering (VBS) at the LHC, the HL-LHC is expected to provide a more complete pictureof these processes, including the option to measure po-larized components, thanks to the higher statistics andimproved detectors.
14.9.4 New-physics searchesThe HL-LHC will allow us to test BSM phenomenathat are beyond the reach of current analyses [1281].
Many BSM models predict the existence of new parti-cles, which can be searched for at HL-LHC, exploitingthe much larger statistics and detector upgrades.
Inthecaseofsupersymmetry(SUSY),theextensionof the kinematic reach is reflected in improved sensitiv-ity to sleptons, gluinos and squarks. In the strong SUSYsector, HL-LHC will probe gluino masses up to3.2 TeV,in R-parity conserving scenarios and under several pos-sible assumptions on the gluino prompt decay mode.
This significantly extends the reach of LHC Run 2. Inthe context of R-parity conserving models, scenarios inwhich the mass difference between the produced su-perpartners and the lightest superpartner (LSP) theydecay into is small (usually calledcompressed SUSY)are the most difficult to study experimentally, and havebeen barely covered at the LHC till now. At the HL-LHC, these scenarios will be studied by using mono-jetand mono-photon signatures as well as VBF produc-tion.
An interesting scenario in the search for dark mat-ter is the one containing a dark photon that couplesvery weakly to charged particles. Prospects for an in-clusive search for dark photons decaying into muon orelectron pairs indicate that the HL-LHC could covera large fraction of the theoretically favored parameterspace.
The flavor anomalies in B-decays suggest the pos-sible presence of new states, such asZ′ or leptoquarks(LQ), coupling to second and/or third generation SMfermions. The HL-LHC will be able to cover a signif-icant portion of the parameter space of these models,withan exclusion reachup to 4 TeVfor theZ′.Pairpro-duced scalar LQs coupling toµ(τ) andb-quarks, on the14.9 High- pT physics at HL-LHC 563other hand, can be excluded up to masses of 2.5 (1.5)TeV, depending on the assumptions on the couplings.
14.9.5 QCD challengesAlready now the LHC experiments have reached a veryhighlevelofsophisticationinthereconstructionofcolli-sion events, thereby making precise measurements pos-sible despite the complex environment and substantialpileup.
Even though significant progress has been made inQCD and electro-weak (EW) calculations for hard pro-cesses in the last few years (see Section 11.1), furtherprogress will be needed to avoid theory uncertaintiesto become the limiting factor in interpreting a widerange of HL-LHC data. For example, in the case ofHiggs boson couplings, the projections of Figure14.9.1show that theory uncertainties will be a limiting factoreven if reduced by a factor of two with respect to theircurrent values. Progress on the theory side is thereforeneeded and it is indeed expected in the following areas:1. Parton Distribution functions: All hard scat-tering reactions at the LHC are eventually initiatedby a partonic collision. The parton scattering rate,which is computed perturbatively, is weighted bythe PDFs, whose knowledge is therefore requiredto extract fundamental couplings from cross sec-tion measurements or from kinematic distributions.
PDFs are also a fundamental input to predict thetails of the distributions of SM processes at highQ2or highpT, which in turn allow us to probe possiblenew physics effects. The current knowledge of PDFswill be improved at HL-LHC by accurate measure-ments of SM processes with jets, vector bosons andtop quarks. LHCb data also have the potential tofurther constrain the PDFs. At scalesQ> 100 GeVthe HL-LHC data can reduce PDF uncertainties bya factor between 2 and 4, depending on the processand on the assumptions on systematic uncertainties[3874].
2. Benchmark processes at high accuracy: Theexperimental precision for many benchmark2 →1and 2 → 2 processes (the most significant exam-ple being Drell-Yan lepton pair production) is likelyto approach the1% level, over a substantial rangeof phase space. Perturbative QCD predictions atnext-to-next-leading order (NNLO) normally do notreach 1% precision, and N3LO accuracy might beneeded for a range of2 →1 and 2 →2 processes.
For example, N3LO predictions for Higgs and vec-tor boson production are already available [1909,3404, 3405, 3411, 3412, 3495, 4771] and are cru-cial to control perturbative uncertainties. The im-proved theoretical control of simple processes willin turn improve our knowledge of PDFs, allowingN3LO PDF fits, with impact on the whole rangeof LHC processes, and will also increase the sen-sitivity to BSM effects manifesting themselves assmall deviations from SM predictions. A first ap-proximate N3LO PDF fit has been recently pre-sented in Ref. [3044].
3. 2 →3 processes at few-percent accuracy: Thereare anumber of crucially importantsignal and back-ground processes that involve a2 →3 scatteringstructure at parton level; these are at the currentfrontier of NNLO calculations. While calculations of3-jetproductionratesbecamerecentlyavailable[ 3369],processes like t¯tH, t¯tV, H + 2 jets are only knownup to NLO and would benefit from the extension toNNLO121. Thet¯tH cross section, e.g., is now mea-sured with roughly15% statistical precision and isexpected to be known with a statistical precision of∼2% at the end of the HL-LHC. Without NNLOQCD and NLO EW accurate calculations for signaland backgrounds, this experimental precision can-not be matched on the theory side, thereby limitingthe exploitation of the results for physics studies.
A significant amount of work is currently being de-voted to break the2 →3 barrier for two-loop ampli-tudes involving massive particles. At the same time,an effort is ongoing to improve available methods toisolate and cancel infrared singularities (see Section11.1 for more details). In the HL-LHC era the com-plete availability of combined NNLO precision inthe strong coupling and NLO precision in the EWcoupling would be desirable.
4. Accuracy at high pT: Current measurements haveonly explored a limited range of the available phasespace.NNLOaccuratedifferentialcrosssectionspavethe way to more detailed data/theory comparisonsin less populated phase-space regions where newphysics effects could be hidden. An important ex-ample is provided by high-pT Higgs production. TheATLASandCMScollaborationsanticipatean O(10%)precision in the Higgs boson production rate forpT ≥350 GeV at the end of the HL phase of theLHC [4768].
The recent computations of2 →2 amplitudes medi-ated by massive quarks [3348, 4773], combined withNNLO calculations in the heavy-top limit [3400,3401, 4774–4776] offer a comparable precision in theSM prediction, and will therefore allow us to disen-tangle possible new physics effects in this region.
121 First NNLO results for inclusivet¯tH production have beenrecently presented in Ref. [4772].
