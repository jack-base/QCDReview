In addition, the improved particle detectors, withhighly granular calorimeters and high resolution recon-struction of charged tracks are enabling reconstructionof the full jet four momentum, investigation of the jetinternal structure and classification of jets via tagging.

12 Measurements at collidersConveners:Karl Jakobs and Eberhard KlemptSince the successful operation of theSp¯pSat CERNand the Tevatron at Fermilab, the high-energy frontierof particle physics is defined by colliders. The Large-Electron-Positron (LEP) collider, operating from 1989to 2000, allowed the collaborations to confirm the gaugestructure of QCD and to test QCD systematically (Ste-fan Kluth). The most significant results of HERA, theonly electron-proton collider operating from 1992 to2007,werestudiesofthestructureofnucleonspresentedin Section 10. The physics of the Brookhaven Relativis-tic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is discussed in Section7.
Theformationofjets,ofstreamsofcollimatedhadrons,was first observed at SPEAR, later in all colliders. AsoutlinedbyDanielBritzger,KlausRabbertzandMarkusWobisch, the production of jets developed to a QCDtesting ground to searches for new phenomena up to thelargest accelerator-based energies at the Large HadronCollider (LHC). Jets initiated by gluons, quarks – in-cluding the heavy quarksc and b – can be producedjointly with the vector bosonsW± and Z0. The crosssections of all these processes are precisely reproducedby QCD calculations (Monica Dunford). The discoveryoftheHiggsin2012wasamilestoneforparticlephysics.
Chiara Marotti describes with which surprising preci-sion the properties of the Higgs boson follow the pre-dictions of the SM. The top quark, discvovered in 1995at Tevatron and discussed here by Marcel Vos, is iden-tified in a large variety of reactions, from top-anti-topproduction to t¯t production associated with a vectorboson or the production of twot¯t pairs. The cross sec-tions for these processes span a wide range from nearly103 pb down to a few10−2 pb.
12.1 The Legacy of LEPStefan KluthThe large electron positron collider LEP was con-ceived and designed at CERN in the 1980’s to studythe then just discovered massive vector bosons of theStandard Model (SM), the neutral Z and the chargedW± bosons [3611]. The four LEP experiments ALEPH,DELPHI, L3 and OPAL collected more than four mil-lion Z decays and about 10,000 W pairs each. TheLEP 2 runs at centre-of-mass (cms) energies above theZresonanceupto209GeVprovidedsamplesofO(1000)hadronic final states from off-shell (Z/γ)∗ decays ateach cms energy. These data, together with the ex-tremely accurate LEP beam energy determination, es-tablished”electro-weakprecisionobservables”(EWPO)and the confirmation of the SM at very high preci-sion [3612].
Hadronic final states at LEP are also a great labo-ratory to study a large spectrum of QCD predictions.
The missing initial- and final-state interference and thecomparatively high energy lead to clearly interpretablehadronic final states and usually small corrections from418 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSnon-perturbativeeffects.AllLEPexperimentshaveamongtheirfirstfewpublicationspapersonpropertiesofhadronicZ decays.
The detectors of the LEP experiments were signif-icant improvements on their predecessors and offeredan almost complete coverage of the solid angle with ef-ficient and precise tracking and finely grained calorime-ters with layers for electromagnetic and hadronic show-ers. All LEP experiments had silicon micro-vertex de-tectors and full coverage with muon detection systemsoutside of the calorimeters.
The e+e− initial state with well known beam en-ergies provides a strong constraint to improve energymeasurements. For example the scaled jet energies inZ decays to 3-jets can be determined from jet anglesonly [3613]. Even without using the beam energy di-rectly in a constraint the use of quantities scaled to thecms energy reduces dependence on the absolute energyscale of the detector. As explained below, jet defini-tions, event shape observables and particle spectra arenormalised to the cms energyQ= √s. Note that in themeasurements the normalisation toQis replaced by themeasured total visible energyEvis which also partiallyremoves the influence of statistical fluctuations.
Compared to previous experiments the LEP datahave much larger event samples on the Z peak, lowexperimental systematic uncertainties and higher cmsenergies leading to smaller and well controlled hadroni-sation corrections.
The data taken on the Z peak (LEP 1) have fa-vorable experimental conditions. The trigger efficiencyfor hadronic final states is essentially 100% and can bemeasured using redundant triggers. Backgrounds fromhadronic decays of τ lepton pairs are suppressed bydemanding more than four charged particles. Require-ments on balance of observed momentum along thebeam direction and total visible energy remove back-groundsfrom e+e− →2γ →hadronsinteractions.Thereare corrections for initial state photon radiation effects,but on the Z peak these are small.
The data taken at√s>m Z but below the thresh-old forW+W− pair production (LEP 1.5) at√s= 130and 136 GeV already contain a substantial fraction ofso-called ”radiative return” interactionse+e− →γISR +Z →hadrons107. Simply speaking, instead of a high-energy interaction near the nominal√s, a Z decay tohadrons recoiling against the ISR photonγISR is pro-duced. The LEP collaborations developed algorithms toreconstruct the effective cms energy√s′ of the observedhadronic system by assuming a 2-body decay togetherwith one or more high-energy ISR photons.

Fig. 12.1.1The figure shows the distribution of reconstructedeffective cms energies√s′rec in hadronic final states ine+e−collisions at√s= 200 GeV. The data are compared with simu-lations of hadronic final states mediated by a single (Z/γ)∗(q¯q Sim.) and W+W− or ZZ pair production (WW+ZZSim.) [3615].
The data taken at√s ≥2mW (LEP 2) include anincreasing fraction of so-called ”4-fermion” final statesincluding quarks. These 4-fermion final states are dom-inated by W+W− pair production in the all-hadronicor lepton+jets channel depending on the decays of theW bosons. The di-lepton channel is after a hadronicpreselection a rather small background. The LEP col-laborations developed sophisticated selections for theW+W− pairs for the precise measurements of W bosonproperties designed to reject ”2-fermion” final stateswith quarks e+e− →(Zγ)∗ →q¯q →hadrons [3614].
These results are then basis of selections for hadronicfinal states produced via a(Z/γ)∗ at high energy. Theremaining 4-fermion background in the data increaseswith √s to about 10% at the highest LEP 2 energiesbut contributes mostly in regions of the distributionsdominated by multi-jet topologies, see e.g. [3615]. Fig-ure 12.1.1 shows the distribution of√s′rec observedfor hadronic final states at √s = 200 GeV by DEL-PHI [3615]. The peak at mZ ≃ 91.2 GeV is due tohadronic Z decays recoiling against photon ISR. Theanalysis imposes a cut on√s′rec to select the peaknear the nominal √s = 200 GeV. The yellow shadedarea shows the simulated background contribution ofW+W− and ZZ final states with hadrons.12.1 The Legacy of LEP 41912.1.1 Gluon propertiesThe gluon was established as one of the elementary par-ticles of the SM by the PETRA experiments, see sec-tion 2.2. QCD requires for its gauge bosons that theyhave spin-1, and that they carry colour charge them-selves manifesting in the three- and four-gluon verticesof the QCD Lagrangian.
The phenomenological analysis of [3616] based onmeasurements of jet axes in Y decays to three glu-ons provided evidence for the spin-1 assignment. Themethod of calculating QCD predictions for spin-0 andspin-1 gluons of [3616] was the basis of an analysisby OPAL using the energy distribution of the 2nd jetafter energy ordering in hadronic Z decays to threejets [3613]. The 2nd jet energy distribution after cor-rection for experimental and hadronisation effects wasin good agreement with a NLO QCD prediction while aMC based LO calculation with scalar gluons showed anestimated χ2/dof = 44 /14. This is clearly well aboverequirements for a discovery. A similar study is dis-cussed in [3617].
The search strategy for directly observable effectsat LEP of the three gluon vertex of QCD was dis-cussed in [3618], but convincing results could only beobtained after NLO calculations for the angular cor-relations between four jets in hadronic Z decays be-came available [3619]. The QCD predictions at NLOdecompose into contributions proportional to (productsof) the color factorsCF, CFCA, CFCF and CFNFTF,and two of them can be determined together with thestrong coupling αS(M2Z). The analyses by OPAL andALEPH [3620, 3621] determineCA and CF correspond-ing to the contributions of three-gluon or quark-gluonvertices to the NLO predictions. The contribution ofthe three-gluon vertex proportional toCA is clearly ob-served. Since the result for the second color factor prod-uct can be recast as CF in these analyses, the colorcharge of quarks at the strength required by QCD isobserved as well.
The analysis of event shape observables Thrust andC-parameter (see below for details) at several cms en-ergy points from re-analysed JADE (at PETRA) dataand OPAL data is based on the same decomposition ofthe NLO QCD prediction and also results in a clear ob-servation of the three-gluon vertex contribution [3622].
A combination of these and other results for determi-nations of the color factors is discussed in [3623]. Fig-ure 12.1.2 shows a summary of the results forCA andCF from 4-jet angular correlations, event shapes, andother analyses [3623].

12.1.2 Jets and event shapesJet and event shape observables have been designed tostudy properties of hadronic final states at colliders.
The aim generally is to classify hadronic final states ac-cording to their topology by introducing an additionalenergy scale. E.g. for clustering hadronic final statesin e+e− annihilation with the JADE algorithm [3626]m2ij = 2 EiEj(1 −cos θij) is the distance between twoobjects i and j with energies Ei and Ej. At each it-eration the pair ij with the smallest distance mij ismerged by adding the pair’s 4-vectors108. One can in-troduce the scaled quantityycut = m2cut/s and counthow many events have three jets when the clustering isstopped atycut. Alternatively, the value ofy23 = m223/swhere in each event the clustering goes from three totwo jets can be used to classify events [3627]. In thefirst case jet rates are studied and in the second anevent shape observable is used. The Thrust observableT = max⃗ n∑i|⃗ pi·⃗ n|/∑i|⃗ pi|, whereiruns over all par-ticles in the hadronic final state,⃗ pi are the particle 3-momenta,and ⃗ nisaunitvector,inasimilarwaydefinesafter optimisation an energy scale given by the sum ofprojections of all 3-momenta on the thrust axis⃗ nT.
108 This is the E-scheme, other merging schemes exist.420 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSThe value of an event shape observable is the classi-fier which can distinguish between e.g. collimated 2-jetlike events and broader 3-jet (or multi-jet) like events.
Their distributions reflect the proportion of 2-jet likevs. 3-jet or multi-jet like events in the data in a similarway as the fraction of 3-jet events at a fixed value ofycut.
As discussed by Dokshitzer in section2.3, it is theproperty of infrared-collinear safety which allows forstable prediction by perturbative QCD (pQCD) andthus a meaningful comparison between experimentalobservations and pQCD predictions. However, beforea successful quantitative comparison of experiment andtheory can be made the transition from the partons ofpQCD calculations to the observed hadrons in the de-tector (hadronisation) must be accounted for. If therewas a major redistribution of 4-momenta between par-tonsandhadronsinagivenfinalstateduetohadronisa-tion then a comparison of pQCD predictions with datawould be highly problematic. Turning this argumentaround we must have a hadronisation process which islocal in phase space. This is discussed as ”local partonhadron duality” (LPHD) by Dokshitzer in section2.3.
Experimental evidence for the LPHD collected by theLEP experiments and previous studies is discussed be-low.
Figure 12.1.3 (left) shows as an example the mea-surements by OPAL of the event shape observableyD23at cms energies √s = 91 .2, 133, 177 and 197 GeV.
The cms energies are weighted averages of combinedLEP runs with similar cms energies. The observableyD23 is the value of the jet distance in the Durham algo-rithm [168] y= 2 min( Ei,EJ)2(1 −cos θij)/swhere thenumber of jets changes from three to two. Figure12.1.3(right) shows measurements by ALEPH [3628] of n-jet,n = 1 ,..., 6+ production fractions using the Durhamalgorithm. These data show that at LEP hadronic fi-nal states with complex jet topologies can be measuredwell.
The reasonably successful comparisons of the datawith simulations by the Monte Carlo event generatorsPYTHIA, HERWIG and ARIADNE validate the ex-perimental corrections derived using these simulationsafter passing them through the simulations of the de-tectors. Furthermore, they pave the way for using thesesimulationstoderivethehadronisationcorrectionsneededto compare pQCD predictions with the data. The finalLEP measurements and their comparison to the thenrelevant NLO+NLLA QCD predictions and determi-nations of αS(mZ) are discussed in [3623]. Improveddeterminations of αS(mZ) using NNLO QCD predic-tions combined with resummed NLLA calculation ap-peared soon after the NNLO predictions became avail-able [3630–3633]The QCD analyses of some jet rates and event shapedistributions (starting at 3-jet final states) from LEPand previouse+e− experiments today has reached per-cent level precision using pQCD predictions at NNLOcombined with resummation up to N3LL. For examplein [280] distributions of Thrust at√s= 35 to 200 GeVare analysed in a global fit based on NNLO+N3LLQCD predictions109. The hadronisation corrections areapplied using an analytic model integrated into the pre-diction. The final result isαS(mZ) = 0 .1135 ±0.0011andhasarelativeuncertaintyof1%.Asimilarmeasure-ment using the C-parameter is [281], the energy-energycorrelation EEC was analysed in NNLO+NNLL accu-racy and the 2-jet rate with the Durham algorithm wasstudied with N3LO+NNLL predictions [3634].
Limitations for the ultimate accuracy of these stud-iesarecurrentlytheuncertaintiesconnectedwithhadro-nisation corrections, see e.g. [3635] for a recent study.
An early study [3628] based on event shapes at allLEP energies and NLO+NLL pQCD found differencesin αS(mZ) of about 10% between results using MCsimulations or an analytic model to derive hadronisa-tion corrections. These differences became smaller withmore complete QCD predictions such as NNLO+NNLLor NNLO+N3LL. They also tend to reduce when MCsimulations with NLO calculations matched to the par-ton shower are used. In both cases a larger fraction ofthe prediction is contributed by pQCD and thus onlya smaller difference w.r.t. the data is left to be coveredby hadronisation corrections. New studies show thatthe hadronisation corrections in an improved analyticmodel depend on the event shape value [3636], in con-trast with the analytic models used so far.
The analyses of final states with four or more jetsare based on the accurate measurements of multi-jetrates and corresponding event shape distributions atLEP. Similar to NLO QCD predictions for angular cor-relations in 4-jet final states also NLO predictions for4-jet rates became possible [3637]. It is important torealise that for 4-jet final states the NLO QCD predic-tion is O(α2S) + O(α3S) which implies a sensitivity toαS larger by about a factor of 2 compared with a pre-diction for 3-jet final states. The higher sensitivity cancompensate for the larger experimental uncertainties ofthe 4-jet measurements w.r.t. 3-jet measurements. Thecorresponding analyses with LEP data are [3615, 3638]while [3639] is a study based on re-analysed data fromJADE at PETRA.
Automated NLO QCD calculations allowed predic-tions for 5-jet observables [3640] and the corresponding109 The exact power counting is explained in [280].12.1 The Legacy of LEP 42191 GeV133 GeV (× 3)177 GeV (× 9)197 GeV (× 27)OPAL(1/σ )⋅dσ /dyD23PYTHIAHERWIGARIADNE197 GeV(MC − data)/error91 GeVyD2310-111010 210 310 410-310-210-1-50510-310-210-1-50510-310-210-1Fig. 12.1.3(left) The figure shows measurements of the event shape observableyD23 by OPAL at average cms energies as indicated.

The review of measurements ofαS(Q) in section3showsclearlythatthestrongcouplingstrengthdecreaseswith increasing energy scale of the process, i.e. asymp-totic freedom. Here we discuss direct experimental ev-idence without performing measurements of αS. Fig-ure 12.1.3 (left) shows distributions ofyD23 measured atcms energies from 91 to 197 GeV and a change in thedistribution is clearly visible. A more direct way to ob-serve a change of the strong coupling strength with theenergy scale of the processQ = √s is to use inclusiveobservables such as jet production rates at a fixed valueof ycut or moments of event shape observables.
In QCD in LO the prediction for the mean valueof e.g. the Thrust1 −T distribution is ⟨1 −T⟩(Q) =αS(Q2)A1−T whiletherunningcouplingfollows αS(Q2) =αS(µ2)/(1+αS(µ2)β0 ln(x2µ)),β0 = (11CA−4TFNF)/(12π),xµ = Q/µ, µ is the renormalisation scale. This implies1/⟨1 −T⟩∼ ln Q at LO with O(α2S) corrections. Fig-ure12.1.4displaysdatafrom DELPHIandlowerenergyexperiments for1/⟨1 −T⟩as a function ofQ on a log-arithmic scale confirming the QCD prediction for therunning coupling as measured by⟨1−T⟩. Hadronisationcorrections to ⟨1 −T⟩are predicted using simulationsto only change the logarithmic slope, see e.g. [3641].
Earlier studies using JADE (at PETRA) data for 3-jetrates using the JADE algorithm as a function of cmsenergy had already proven the running strong couplingat the 4-σ level [3642].
12.1.3 F ragmentationThe term fragmentation refers to measuring and pre-dicting properties of the hadrons produced in hadronicfinal states. In contrast, hadronisation refers to modifi-cationstoobservablesderivedfromhadronicfinalstatessuch as event shapes or jet rates. In studies of fragmen-tation of hadrons the energies or momentum compo-nents w.r.t. an event orientation or jet axis, or theirmultiplicity, are studied.
The scaled momentum fraction of a hadron withmomentum p is defined asx = 2 p/Q.

interactions of the partons, that thex-spectra are in-dependent of √s. This is analogous to the predictionof scaling forxBj in lepton-hadron DIS, i.e. that dis-tributions ofxBj are independent of the 4-momentumtransfer Q2 of the DIS process. Scaling violations arethen due to scale-dependent strong interactions of thepartons. Figure12.1.5 shows as an example the ratio ofmeasurements ofx-spectra measured by ALEPH on theZ peak to corresponding measurements by TASSO (atPETRA) measured at√s= 22 GeV [3643]. The scalingviolations are clearly visible.
The QCD analysis of scaling violations of scaled mo-mentum distributions measured at different cms ener-gies is thee+e− analog of the analysis of structure func-tionsF2(Q2,xBj) in lepton-hadron DIS. The scaled mo-mentum distribution is described by1σhdσhdx =∫ 10∑fCf(z,αS(µ),xµ)Df(xz,µ)dzz(12.1.1)with the flavour index f = u,d,s,c,b,g .

NNLO framework for the analysis of scaled momentumdistributions ine+e− annihilation to hadrons is [3644].
It is interesting to focus on low momentum hadrons.
To this end the variable ξ = ln(1 /x) is introduced.
The majority of hadrons is produced at low values ofx and by transforming to ξ their properties can bestudied in more detail. As an example figure 12.1.6shows measurements ofξ for charged hadrons at LEPby OPAL and also from previous experiments at lowerenergies [3645]. The distributions show a maximum anddrop quickly towards small ξ corresponding to largehadron momenta. At largeξ, i.e. for small momenta,the distributions fall off faster than expected from thekinematic limits from hadron masses.
This can be explained by destructive interference ofmultiple soft gluon radiation in the parton shower, of-ten named soft gluon coherence. Under the assumptionof LPHD the production of soft hadrons is driven bythe production of soft gluons from the parton shower.
The ”QCD Chudakov effect” means that soft gluonscannot resolve the individual parton color charges andinstead the smaller color charge before branchings isrelevant. Based on these ideas detailed pQCD predic-tions for multiple soft gluon radiation are calculated.
For figure12.1.6 such predictions [3646] are shown bythe solid and dashed lines, where the solid lines arefitted to the data and the dashed lines are extrapo-lations. The extrapolated QCD predictions at smallξ(large x) are not expected to be a good approximationwhile at largeξ (small x) the data are well described.12.1 The Legacy of LEP 4230123456780 1 2 3 4 5 6OPALOPAL 202 GeVOPAL 133 GeVOPAL 91 GeVTOPAZ 58 GeVTASSO 44 GeVTASSO 35 GeVTASSO 22 GeVTASSO 14 GeVξ p1/σ dσ ch/dξ pFig. 12.1.6The figure shows the spectra ofξ= ln(1 /x) mea-sured by OPAL, TOPAZ and TASSO [3645]. The data are com-pared with fitted QCD predictions, see text for details.
The evolution of the peak position with cms energy ex-tracted from the fits also follows the pQCD prediction,see e.g. [3645]. These measurements provide convincingexperimental confirmation of the LPHD and the corre-sponding pQCD calculations. A recent analysis of theξspectra measured ine+e− annihilation and other pro-cesses including higher order corrections is [3647].
The interpretation of [3648], based on simulationswith and without soft gluon interference (coherence)effects, that the data of scaled momentum spectra donot provide evidence for coherence has been discussedin [3649]. There it was pointed out that the hadronisa-tion models of the simulation programs will compensatefor the lack of coherence effects to still give a reasonabledescription of the data. The confirmation of the LPHDlies in the successful comparison of the correspondingQCD calculations with the data involving only two freenormalisation and scale parameters.
The QCD parton shower picture, i.e. the idea ofhigh-momentum partons radiating many times a gluon,and also gluons producing aq¯q pair, is the basis of thesimulationprograms,becauseitallowsimplementationsas iterative probabilistic branchings. The implementa-tions of the parton shower picture are approximationscorrectly summing leading logarithmic terms (LLA). Inthe LLA the soft gluon interference effects correspondto the angular ordering phenomenon: a subsequent par-ton branching must occur at branching angles smallerthan the previous one. There are limitations to the an-gular ordering approximation for less inclusive observ-ables [3650], in particular some which are used for tun-ing (optimisation of agreement with data) of the simu-lation programs.
The legacy of LEP in this area is the wealth ofprecise data on event shape observables, jet produc-tion, spectra of inclusive and identified hadrons, andmultiplicities which can in many cases be interpretedwith little ambiguities. These data are to a large partthe basis for parameter settings of the popular simula-tion programs used in our field and in particular at theLHC [3559, 3576, 3651].
The topic of colour reconnection (CR) concerns pos-sible changes to hadronisation effects if several coloursinglet sources are produced in a collision. The questionis: do the final partons after the parton showers of dif-ferent colour singlet sources form hadrons together ornot. At LEP 2 the production ofe+e− →W+W− →hadrons final states was an important contribution tothe LEP 2 measurements of the mass and other proper-ties of the W boson [3614]. The modeling uncertaintiesof CR effects gave rise to significant systematic errorson the W boson mass and width, after measurements ofparticle flow between the four jets of the two hadronicW decays were used to constrain different CR mod-els. New models for CR were discussed in [3574] andcompared with the LEP 2 measurements. CR also af-fects measurements of the top quark mass due to theintermediate colour singlet W boson in the top quarkdecay [3652] and due to interactions of proton remnants(multi parton interactions MPI) in pp collisions. Recentmeasurements from LHC take this into account [476,3653]. The CR model with the biggest impact on theresults of [3653] is also the only one in tension withLEP 2 data in [3574]. This shows that the LEP datacan still help to constrain CR models.
12.1.4 Heavy quarksIn QCD with massless quarks the coupling constantis the only free parameter. Asymptotic freedom of therunning strong coupling is one of the defining featuresof QCD and is well confirmed by experiments [3654]since LEP results contributed. Quark masses are alsofree parameters of the theory and subject to similarphenomena as asymptotic freedom for the strong cou-pling. The quark masses are predicted to depend onthe energy scale of the process through so-called massanomalous dimensions, the quark mass analogous of thebeta-function.

The second predic-tion is the suppression of gluon radiation from massivequarks with angle Θ < Θ0 = m/E, where m is theheavy quark mass andE the heavy quark energy. Thisis referred to as the ”dead-cone” effect of QCD [3656].424 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS0.860.880.90.920.940.960.9811.020 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07ycutRpertbd (R3)Data, stat errors onlyPYTHIA 6.1HERWIG 6.1NLO, mb(Mz)=3 GeV/c2NLO, mb(Mz)=5 GeV/c2ALEPHFig. 12.1.7The diagram shows data forB3(ycut) by ALEPHcorrected for experimental and hadronisation effects using theDurham algorithm.

The first prediction of running quark masses wasstudied at LEP using large samples of O(106) hadronicZ decays with b-tags.

A recent analysis by ALICE has found evidence for re-duced particle production inside angular regions consis-tent with the dead cone for charm tagged jets producedin pp collisions at the LHC [176]. The key to this obser-vation was reversing a sequential jet clustering historyusing an angular distance definition110 which enforcesangular ordering by construction.
Predictions for phenomenology of the dead cone ef-fect at LEP concentrate on multiple soft gluon produc-tion and thus on particle spectra or multiplicities [3656,3661]. The so-called ”leading particle effect” refers tolarge and mass dependent average scaled momenta ofheavy hadrons (c or b). The leading particle effect is de-rived from pQCD as a direct consequence of the deadcone and shown to be consistent with data from LEPand previouse+e− colliders [153].
The particle multiplicity in Z decays to b or light (u,d, s) quarks is sensitive to the dead cone effect due to itsimpact on soft gluon radiation, which is directly relatedto particle production via the LPHD. The pQCD pre-diction in the MLLA for the charged particle multiplic-ity difference in hadronic Z decays to b or light quarks isδbl = 4.4 ±0.4 [3662]. A different model forδbl withoutdead cone contributions predicts a fast decrease withcms energy √s.

The τ lepton weak decays to hadrons proceed inthe SM description via a virtual W boson decayingto quarks. Similar to hadronic Z boson decays QCDcorrections to the final state modify the predictions.
At the scale of the τ lepton mass mτ ≃ 1.78 GeVthe strong couplingαS(mτ) ≃0.3 such that large cor-rections are expected. The QCD corrections are alsoknown to N3LO due to the similarity of the calcula-tions. In addition non-perturbative effects are signifi-cant, while they are strongly suppressed for hadronic Zdecays.
A recent analysis of the important theoretical is-sues for the extraction ofαS from hadronic τ leptondecays is [3665]. The data point shows the average ofαS(mZ) determinations by the PDG from 2016 whichhas since been updated with only small changes [476].
The good consistency between these related determi-nations of αS(mZ) is a strong test of the consistentapplication of QCD corrections in the SM, as well asof the understanding of the evolution equations for therunning of the strong coupling including the treatmentof quark mass thresholds.
The large collection of measurements from the LEPexperiments, SLD, and also the previous and partiallyre-analysed experiments at e+e− colliders are a cor-nerstone of the experimental validation of the theoryof strong interactions, QCD. Possible futuree+e− col-liders are designed to deliver at least 1000 times theintegrated luminosity w.r.t. LEP and with more ad-vanced detectors. In addition large samples of Higgsand W+W− bosons, and possibly of top-antitop quarkpairs will open the door to many more tests of the SMincluding its QCD sector, and its proposed extensions.
12.2 High-pT jetsDaniel Britzger, Klaus Rabbertz, andMarkus W obisch12.2.1 IntroductionOne of the most fundamental testing grounds for thepredictions of perturbative QCD (pQCD) are studiesof the production rates of collimated sprays of hadrons,so-called hadronic jets . Although such jets are neitherfundamental entities of the theory nor objects directlymeasurable in experiment, the notion of jets provedto be an extremely useful concept, because it allowsto make the connection between the objects of pQCD,the quarks and gluons or, generically,partons, and thetracks and energy depositions in a detector. In a mea-sured collision event, high-energetic jets can roughly beidentified by eye for example when looking at an eventdisplay in the radial or the transverse plane. However,for an unambiguous attribution of each track and en-ergy deposit to a jet, a mathematical prescription isrequired: ajet algorithm . Equally, to relate experimen-tal measurements of such jets to production rates pre-dictable in perturbative QCD, a precise definition ofpartonic jets is needed. To close the gap, for good jet al-gorithms it must also be demonstrated that correctionsare under control that on the one hand unfold for de-tector effects to the level of stable hadrons as in MonteCarlo event generators, and on the other hand accountfor the non-perturbative transition from partons to the12.2 High- pT jets 427same stable-hadron level. History has shown that jetalgorithms can be found that are suitable simultane-ously for all three levels, measured tracks and energyclusters, the partons of perturbative calculations, andthe hadrons of Monte Carlo event generators used indetector simulations. Alas, it took time approximatelyhalfway through “the first 50 years of QCD” to evolvefrom first ideas to mature jet definitions used in today’sprecision phenomenology. In the following sections, theauthors describe the essential steps of this evolutionfrom their perspective of working at the LEP, HERA,Tevatron, and LHC colliders.
12.2.2 A hint of color: quark- and gluon-initiatedjetsEstablishing QCD as the theory of the strong interac-tion requires us not only to investigate the pattern ofcolorless hadronic particles and their properties, but togo beyond confinement and search for signs of the un-derlying dynamics of this asymptotically free quantumfield theory. In other words, we need to find hints ofcolor even though the confining property of QCD doesnot allow us to directly measure colored quarks — letalone gluons. Indirect evidence came in 1968 from theobservation of Bjorken scaling in Deep-Inelastic Scat-tering (DIS) at SLAC [93, 148], where inelastic scatter-ing of electrons on nucleons at large momentum-trans-fer squared,Q2, is well described by the assumption of avirtual photon interacting with point-like constituentsinside a nucleon. These constituents, named partonsby Feynman, were later identified with the (valence)quarks of Gell-Mann and Zweig [18, 3113].
It is conjectured that the struck parton should man-ifest itself in the form of a collimated stream of hadronsmoving along the direction of the primary parton withonly a few hundred MeV of transverse momentum, likedefined asjet in the introduction. This brings us to thesecond question implicit in this section’s title “high-pTjets”: How high is “high”? The center-of-mass ener-gies of a few GeV available at the time were insuffi-cient to clearly observe well separated jets simply be-cause the opening angles of the hadron streams werefar too large and the “jets” interleaved with each othereven though the back-to-back orientation of the pri-mary q¯q pair should guarantee their maximal separa-tion. A way out was found by focusing on the maininterest to differentiate between a two-jet like struc-ture favored by QCD and the expectations from othermodels. Instead of reconstructing jets or jet quantitiesexplicitly, the strategy rather consists in searching fora principal event axis along which most of the momen-tum of each produced hadron is aligned. In 1975, theSLAC-LBL Mark I experiment at thee+e− storage ringSPEAR usedsphericity [3666, 3667], which defines suchan event axis by minimizing the sum of squares of allmomenta with respect to this axis. The event shapesphericity,S, is then defined asS = 3∑i(p2T,i)/2∑i|⃗ pi|2 , (12.2.1)where the sum is over all particlesi in the event with3-momenta ⃗ pi and transverse momenta pT,i with re-spect to the sphericity axis. Each event is characterizedby one number S ranging from zero, when all parti-cles are fully aligned along the axis, up to unity forisotropic events. By means of defining such an eventaxis for their measurements at 3.0, 3.8, 4.8, 6.2, and7.4GeV center-of-mass energy, the Mark I experimentfound first evidence for quark-initiated jet productionemerging when going to the higher center-of-mass en-ergies [105]. Moreover, profiting from polarized beams,by comparing the angular distribution of the spheric-ity axis ofq¯q production to the one ofe+e− →µ+µ−they concluded that the potential partons must havespin 1/2 rather than spin0.
How about gluons then, the exchange quanta ofQCD? Do they exist and, if yes, how do they mani-fest themselves? In 1976 Ellis, Gaillard, and Ross [104]argued gluon bremsstrahlung e+e− →q¯qg to be theleading correction toq¯q dijet production. As a conse-quence,withincreasingcenter-of-massenergyoneofthetwoquark-initiatedjetsshouldexhibitsignsofwideningup with higher multiplicity until finally a third gluon-initiated jet emerges leading to planar 3-jet events. Thecenter-of-mass energies available at SPEAR and alsoDORIS at DESY, however, were not sufficient to pro-videevidencefor3-jetproduction,althoughvaluablere-sults could be achieved by investigating the conjectureddominant decay of the upsilon resonance into three glu-ons, Υ →ggg, confirming predictions by QCD includ-ing the vector character of the gluons [3668]. Only themuch higher center-of-mass energy of 27GeV reachedby the PETRA collider at DESY in spring 1979 couldprovide sufficiently high-energetice+e− collisions suchthat clearly identifiable 3-jet events could be produced.
The first event display of the TASSO Collaboration waspresented by Wiik at the “Neutrino 79” conference inBergen [91] and, of course, is also reproduced in thiscommemorative work, see the section by S.L. Wu for amore personal recollection of events. Subsequently, allfour experiments at PETRA published clear evidencefor planar 3-jet events affirming the discovery of thegluon and gluon-induced jets [92, 109–111].
The increasinge+e− center-of-mass energies at PE-TRA, TRISTAN, SLC, and LEP up to√s = 209 GeV428 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSallowed a plethora of (multi-)jet measurements to beperformed, all confirming the conjectures of QCD astheory of the strong interaction. Notably, the rate ofevents with three jets as compared to dijet productionis to first order proportional to the strong coupling,which then can be extracted at each energy point todemonstrate its energy dependence orrunning as pre-dicted by QCD.
Finally, angular correlations in 4-jet events are sen-sitive already at leading order (LO) to the color factorsCA = 3 and CF = 4 /3 of the non-Abelian special uni-tary group SU(3) of QCD and thus are probing its non-Abelian nature as described in the previous section. Acompilation of constraints on these color factors is pre-sented in Ref. [3623], where world average values arequoted that are in perfect agreement with the expecta-tions from QCD.
12.2.3 Jets at hadron-hadron collidersDespite great new insights obtained thanks to high-precision measurements ate+e− colliders, the term ofdiscovery machines generally is reserved for hadron-hadron colliders. Because of the much larger mass ofprotons as compared to electrons, the huge loss of en-ergyperturnincircularstorageringsduetosynchrotronradiation can be avoided enabling much higher collisionenergies of e.g.p¯p accelerators than possible with cir-cular e+e− beams. The benchmark observable of jetphysics at hadron-hadron colliders is the inclusive jetproduction cross section and in the early days the phasespace was divided up into intervals of the jet transverseenergyET and the jet pseudorapidityηdefined in termsof the polar angleθ as η= −ln tan(θ/2). Measured jetyields are transformed into a double-differential crosssection viad2σdET dη = 1ϵ·Lint· Njets∆ET∆η, (12.2.2)where Njets is the number of jets counted within a bin,corrected for detector distortions,ϵ is the experimen-tal efficiency, and∆ET and ∆η are the respective binwidths.
The first such measurement of inclusive jet produc-tion was published in 1982 by the UA2 Collaborationwith data recorded in the so-calledjet run at the Sp¯pScollideroperatingat 540 GeVcenter-of-massenergy[ 3669].
Theobservedsteepdecreaseofthejet ET spectrumpro-portional to E−nT with n ≈9 was correctly predictedby QCD at LO [3670]. Firm conclusions on the abso-lute normalization, however, were not possible becauseof large experimental and theoretical uncertainties, andlack of a well-defined jet algorithm. The UA2 Collab-oration employed a cell-based clustering of energy de-posits in the calorimeters, where neighboring cells couldbe merged into one cluster. A “final” cluster could besplit up again, if it contained multiple, well separatedmaxima. Instead of referring directly to cell geometry,the UA1 experiment used an algorithm based on conesof radius R equal to unity in(η,φ) space in order todecide whether cells are merged or not [3671]. Here,φis the azimuthal angle. To initiate a jet, cells exceed-ing a minimal transverse energy are taken in decreasingorder of ET as “seeds”, around which cells within thedefined cone are combined with this seed to form thejet. This algorithm corresponds already to a cone jetalgorithm; alas, it suffers from a number of shortcom-ings like unclustered energy or sensitivity to collinearsplittings further described in the next section. Never-theless, at the level of the limited experimental preci-sion and with only order-of-magnitude predictions atLO, jet measurements conducted at the Sp¯pS and stillat the Intersecting Storage Rings ISR [3672] were inagreement with expectations from QCD.
12.2.4 The evolution of jet algorithmsUntil the end of the 1980s, a vast amount of jet datafrom hadron colliders were collected, reaching a level ofprecision of 10%. Predictions at LO in pQCD, however,were very limited in precision by the uncompensateddependence on the renormalization scale , µr, throughthe running strong coupling. The calculation of next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections to jet productionadvanced the accuracy of perturbative predictions toa comparable level. This progress required a careful re-evaluation of the concept of jets and resulted into newclasses of jet algorithms, since several shortcomings ofprevious jet definitions were identified, which limitedtheir usability in higher-order pQCD predictions or inhadron-induced processes. Let us have a closer look intothe evolution of jet algorithms over time.
The first jet algorithm was described in 1977 byStermanandWeinbergfor e+e− collisions[166].Intheiralgorithm,particleswithmomentapointingtowardsthesame direction within some opening angle were clus-tered together. Most importantly, their jet definitionmade the result insensitive to the emission of eithersoft or collinear particles. This is calledinfrared andcollinear safety , which is crucial to produce finite re-sults at all orders in perturbation theory. Otherwisethe cancellation of soft and collinear singularities asso-ciated with such partonic emissions in calculations ofpQCD is spoiled leading to infinite results. To be use-ful in comparisons to pQCD, the outcome of a jet algo-12.2 High- pT jets 429rithm therefore must neither depend on the addition ofarbitrarily soft clustering objects to the set of inputs,nor on the merging of two collinear input objects or thesplitting of an input object into two collinear ones.
The following decade saw the proposal by Stermanand Weinberg to be generalized in order to analyzehadron-hadron collisions in terms of a number of cone-shaped jets of a chosen jet radius,R, pointing into thedirections of the highest energy or momentum densitiesin an event. In the same period the JADE Collabora-tion at the PETRA collider introduced another type ofjet algorithm based on iterative pairwise clusterings forthe analysis ofe+e− events [3626]. Hence, two classesof jet algorithms emerged:1. cone algorithms that assign objects to the leadingenergy-flow objects in an event based on geometricalcriteria;2. sequential-recombinationalgorithmsthatiterativelycombine the closest pairs of objects.
A summary of jet algorithms discussed at the time ispresented in the proceedings of theSnowmass “SummerStudy on High Energy Physics” [3673].
Althoughintroducedonlyin2008initsgeneralform,one can determine the so-calledcatchment area of a jet,often just namedjet area, for both classes provided thealgorithm is infrared- and collinear-safe [3590]. For conealgorithms defined in(η,φ) space as used already by theUA1 Collaboration, this jet area formerly was identifiedwith the circular area with jet radiusR, which simpli-fied considerably the task of jet energy calibration athadron-hadron colliders.
In e+e− collisions all final-state particles emergefrom the hard subprocess. Therefore, ine+e− measure-ments exclusive jet algorithms were applied, which as-sign each final-state particle to one of the high-pT jets.
Hence, a collision event is classified as an exclusive jetfinal state,e.g. e+e− →n jets and nothing else.
Although being more costly in terms of computingtime, it was affordable to use successive recombinationalgorithms because of the low multiplicity ine+e− an-nihilations. Initially, the JADE algorithm was favored,where pairs of particles are clustered in the order ofincreasing invariant di-particle masses, assuming thiswould result in jets with small invariant masses. In thephenomenology of e+e− physics, it was, however, dis-covered that the JADE algorithm frequently clusterssoftparticlesatlargeangles,cf.alsoFig. 12.2.1,whichisvery disadvantageous for precision calculations [3674].
This problem was addressed in thekt or “Durham al-gorithm” [168]111, in which the distance measure was111 Originally,k⊥ wasusedaslabelinsteadof kt.Forsimplicitywe usekt throughout.
changed from the invariant di-particle mass to the rela-tive transverse momentum,kt, of the particle pair. Thisversion, also called the (exclusive) kt algorithm, wasconfirmed to have superior properties than the JADEalgorithm ine+e− annihilation.

When HERA, the first and only electron–proton(ep) collider, started in 1992, “standard” jet algorithmshad been defined already fore+e− annihilation as dis-cussed.Inhadron–hadroncollisionscone-typealgorithmswere favored over sequential-recombination algorithmsto avoid time-consuming repeated iterations over manyfinal-stateparticles.Nothingyethadbeendevelopedforphysics at anepcollider such that many physicists com-ing from LEP experiments tried to adopt methods asthey were used ine+e− physics. So in the early HERAjet analyses, a modified version of the JADE algorithmwas used (the “mJADE algorithm” [3676]), in whichthe proton beam remnant is treated by introducing apseudo-particle (carrying the missing longitudinal mo-mentum in the event), to which particles can be clus-tered. At the end, all particles are either assigned tothe high-pT jets, or to the jet including the pseudo-particle. The former are considered as then high-pTjets, while the latter is considered to be the (one) beam430 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSremnant. The final states are therefore classified as ex-clusive (n+ 1)-jet final states.
In reactions with initial state hadrons,i.e. ep andhadron-hadron collisions, collinear singularities in thematrix elements of the hard subprocess are factorizedinto process-independent parton distribution functions(PDFs), which depend on thefactorization scale , µf,that defines the limit between attribution to the per-turbative hard process or the non-perturbative hadronstructure in form of the PDFs. This factorization, how-ever, only works, if it is not spoiled by the definitionof the measured quantity that must not depend on thebeam-remnant(s).ForthemJADEalgorithm,itwastheinclusion of the kinematics of the beam-remnant thatmade the algorithm non-factorizable. This issue wasfixed in the exclusivekt algorithm for ep and hadron-hadron collisions by treating the beam remnant(s) asparticles of infinite momentum and thus independentof their actual kinematics. This exclusivekt algorithmwas in use for some time within the HERA experimentsand later was replaced by its inclusive counterpart.
Hadron-hadron andepcollisions share the commonfeature of having activity in their final states related tothe remnant(s) of the beam hadrons. Therefore, the jetdefinitions used in hadron-hadron physics were basedon the cone-type proposal by Sterman and Weinberg todefine a jet by the transverse energies through a cone,which is moved so as to maximize the transverse en-ergy flow through it. In this approach, only selectedfinal-state particles are included in jets. Those, whichare not assigned to jets are effectively interpreted tostem from the so-called Underlying Event that is re-lated to soft processes involving interactions with thebeam remnants. The jet final-states are thus classifiedas inclusive with respect to additional unclustered par-ticles, e.g. pp →n jets plus additional activity, whichcould consist of additional jets and/or unclustered par-ticles.
Anotherdifferencebetween e+e− andhadron-hadronphysics consists in the choice of variables. In hadron-hadron collisions, the center-of-mass frame of the hardsubprocessisboostedlongitudinally, i.e. alongthebeamdirectionwithrespect tothe detectorrest frame.Hence,instead of energies and angles as used ine+e− colli-sions, transverse momenta and/or transverse energiesare used, together with azimuthal angles and eitherthe pseudorapidityη as defined before, or the rapidityy = 1 /2 ·ln [(E+ pz)/(E−pz)], which coincides withη for massless objects. As a consequence, cone-jet algo-rithms in hadron-hadron collisions are used with coneradii R defined in the plane of azimuthal angle and(pseudo)rapidity.
Cone algorithms are, however, not as easy to im-plement as one would naïvely think. The basic idea ofa cone-jet algorithm sounds rather simple: Decide ona cone radius, R, place it in the plane of azimuthalangle and (pseudo)rapidity, compute the transverse en-ergy/momentum flow through the cone, and move thecone over the plane so as to maximize this flow. Be-fore the end of the 1990s, experimental jet measure-ments used a large number of different implementa-tions. These early cone algorithms suffered from a num-ber of problems. Many were not infrared- or collinearsafe, while others had undesired features. Some of theproblems arise from the fact that a true, continuousmaximization procedure of the energy flow through theconerequiredtoomuchcomputingresources,andshort-cuts were applied. Some versions simply defined thefinal jets by building cones around the particles/de-tector clusters of highest energy. Other versions usedthese clusters as starting points, or “seeds” for an it-erative procedure. All of these algorithms were eithernot infrared-, or not collinear-safe, or even both. Otherundesired features emerged through the treatment ofoverlapping cones. Sometimes, it happens that two re-sulting jet cones share a number of particles. To have aunique assignment of particles to jets, anoverlap treat-ment is added to the algorithm, which assigns the par-ticles in the overlap regions uniquely to one of the twojets. This overlap treatment depends on additional pa-rameters (adding to the complexity of the algorithm)and in most cases it also introduced additional vio-lations of infrared or collinear safety. These problemswere ultimately addressed and solved with the Seed-less Infrared-Safe Cone (SISCone) jet algorithm [3677].
By eliminating seeds, and using a refined overlap treat-ment, SISCone became the first (and so far, only) conejet algorithm that is infrared- and collinear safe.
The SISCone algorithm was, however, never widelyused since the rather late time it was introduced. Jetmeasurements had moved on to different jet algorithms:Soon after the introduction of the exclusive kt algo-rithm fore+e− physics and the above-mentioned modi-fications for processes with initial-state hadrons, a sim-ilar inclusive algorithm was introduced the “Cambridgealgorithm” [170]. This algorithm transferred the basicconcepts of the exclusivekt algorithm consistently tohadron-hadron collider physics. In the same way thatthe Cambridge algorithm was a modification of the ex-clusive kt algorithm, a corresponding modification ofthe inclusive kt algorithm was introduced, called the“Aachen algorithm” or, later, the “Cambridge-Aachenalgorithm” [171]. This algorithm recombines pairs ofparticles simply in the order of increasing distances in(y,φ) space. Both algorithms can be specified in a uni-12.2 High- pT jets 431fied way by defining the pairwise distancedij betweenany two objectsi and j, and thebeam distance diB ofeach objecti as:dij = min(p2pT,i,p2pT,j)∆R2ijR2 , (12.2.3)diB = p2pT,i. (12.2.4)Here, the power p is the algorithm defining parame-ter, and∆Rij is the purely “angular” distance in(y,φ)space betweeni and j:(∆Rij)2 = (yi −yj)2 + (φi −φj)2 . (12.2.5)Then, each time the minimal distance of all pairwiseand beam distances is adiB, objectiis declared a finaljet and removed from the list of clustering objects. Ifthe minimal distance is adij instead, the two objectsare merged using four-vector addition into a new objectthatisaddedtotheclusteringlist.Thisisrepeateduntilno more input objects are left.
Settingpequaltounitygivesthe kt algorithm,whilep = 0 corresponds to the Cambridge-Aachen one thatonly considers∆Rij in the clustering and is frequentlyused for studies of jet substructure. Interestingly, as dis-covered in Ref. [174], the choice ofp= −1 is also a validoption, where in contrast to thekt algorithm the clus-tering starts with the highest-pT objects and producesround-shaped jet areas as if from a cone jet algorithm!This third “family member” was dubbed the “anti-ktalgorithm” and was quickly adopted as the main jetalgorithm for jet physics at the LHC.
12.2.5 New physics with jets: excesses in jet crosssectionsThe next stage of establishing QCD as the theory of thestrong interaction was triggered by two developments:the arrival of predictions at NLO in pQCD also forhadron-hadron collisions, and the start of the Tevatroncollider at Fermilab with a p¯p center-of-mass energyranging from 540GeV up to 1.96TeV. The by far dom-inating theoretical uncertainty caused by the largeµrscale dependence of LO predictions was reduced fromfactors of roughly two to 10–30% [3678, 3679]. Addi-tional uncertainties from non-perturbative effects andfrom the proton structure were estimated to lie between5 and 20%, respectively. The latter uncertainty was de-rived from calculations using differentextractions of theproton PDFs from data of deep-inelastic scattering ofleptons on fixed targets [3680–3683]. First comparisonsof these NLO predictions top¯pcollider data from UA2and from the new CDF experiment at Tevatron exhib-ited a very nice agreement.
This picture changed suddenly in 1996 when theCDF Collaboration reported an excess in inclusive jetdataathigh ET beyond200GeVasshowninFig. 12.2.2[3684].
A possible explanation could be new phenomena at anenergy scaleΛ far beyond reach to allowe.g. resonantproduction of new particles. Similarly to Fermi’s low-energy four-fermion coupling to approximate weak in-teractions at scales well below theW boson mass, suchan excess can be described in terms ofcontact interac-tions (CI) [3680,3685].Speculationsaboutsuchcontactinteractions as a possible explanation were, however,quickly abandoned and the results were scrutinized foreffects not properly covered by uncertainties. With re-spect to the proton structure there was no other meansthan taking the spread in predictions using differentproton PDFs, also shown in Fig.12.2.2, as a proxy forthe uncertainty, which now had become very relevant.
As all the PDFs known at the time were potentiallyprone to the same biases, the association of the spreadin the corresponding predictions with a PDF uncer-tainty could only be considered an educated guess or,in the words of Soper [3686]: “This is similar to esti-mating the size of a French mountain valley by takingthe r.m.s. dispersion in the locations of individuals in aflock of sheep grazing in the valley.”The way forward was described in the seminal paperRef. [3687], where a systematic approach was presentedto derive parton distributions with reliable uncertaintyestimations. Using the preliminary PDFs including ex-perimentaluncertaintiesderivedinRef.[ 3688]fromDISdata,theauthorsdemonstratedthattheexcessreportedby the CDF Collaboration can be absorbed in updatedparameter values for the strong coupling constant andthegluondistribution.Whilethequarkpartondistribu-tions are directly determined in DIS, in particular withdata from the new HERA collider as used in Ref. [3688],the DIS data are insufficient to also fixαS(MZ) and thegluon content in the proton. For both, jet cross sectionsmeasured at the Tevatron and at HERA, as describedin the next section, are valuable input to the PDF fits.
12.2.6 The running coupling and the gluon con-tent of the protonHERA, approved in 1984, just became operational dur-ing 1992, the same year as the 20th anniversary ofQCD was celebrated in Aachen [3689].112 At that time,QCD was in a “transition from the stage of early ex-ploratory studies to high precision analyses in QCD”as noted by Zerwas and Kastrup in the introductionto this workshop [2411]. A milestone for testing QCD112 This was the very first conference participation of KR trig-gering his profound interest in jets and QCD.432 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSFig. 12.2.2 Percentual difference between the CDF inclusivejet cross section (points) and a prediction at NLO QCD usingMRSD0’ PDFs.

was achieved by demonstrating experimentally therun-ning of the strong coupling from theτ mass of around2GeV up to the Z boson mass at 91GeV using vari-ous observables and data from different experiments asreported in Ref. [3690]. A first summary of determina-tions ofαS(MZ) was presented by Altarelli [3691] whoconcluded onαS(MZ) = 0 .118 ±0.007.
HERA was constructed as the paramount extensionto the series of previous, very successful fixed-targetlepton-nucleon scattering experiments, which have ledthe way to conceiving QCD as the theory of strong in-teractions. The increase by a factor of ten in the lepton–proton center-of-mass energy promised rich new datafor testing many aspects of QCD. In particular, with√s = 300 GeV, HERA allowed to elucidate the struc-ture of the proton and the running ofαS(µr) by meansof unique and detailed measurements of the hadronicfinal state in addition to the scattered lepton.
The HERA collider at DESY consisted of two inde-pendentacceleratorsdesignedtocollide30GeVelectronand 820GeV proton beams. Two multi-purpose detec-tors,H1andZEUS,wereconceivedtopreciselymeasurethe hadronic final state with almost hermetic coverage.
The main difference between the two experiments withrespect to jets is given by their calorimeters. The H1collaboration opted for a liquid argon calorimeter withelectromagnetic and hadronic sections, both inside thesolenoïd providing the magnetic field [3692, 3693]. TheZEUS collaboration optimized their calorimetric sys-tem for hadronic measurements and employed a com-pensatinguraniumplastic-scintillatorsamplingcalorime-ter [3694]. The overconstrained kinematics of neutral-current DIS events enabled precise in-situ calibrationsfor the electromagnetic and hadronic energy scales suchthat both collaborations could report a jet energy scaleuncertainty of only 1% for jets with transverse mo-mentaexceeding10GeVinthelaboratoryrestframe[ 3695,3696].
Already the first HERA data brought striking QCDresults, like the confirmation of the logarithmic viola-tion of Bjorken scaling shown by theF2 structure func-tion in dependence of the parton fractional momentumx as predicted by QCD [3697, 3698], or support forthe presence of a hadronic structure of quasi-real pho-tons as a result of dijet events observed in photoproduc-tion[3699,3700].Hence,jetswereanintegralpartoftheHERA physics program from the very beginning. Theterm jet physics quickly extended well beyond the sim-ple picture of one “DIS jet”, which is initiated by thestruck quark in the Quark-Parton-Model (QPM) pic-ture, or of dijet topologies in photoproduction. Studiesof further properties like jet charge, substructure, frag-mentation, or the heavy flavor content of jets led tomany more interesting results, which, however, cannotbe covered here. In the following we will limit ourselvesto high-pT jets in neutral-current DIS and will referthe interested reader to other sections in this book orto review articles [3701–3705].
At HERA, for the first time, it became possible tostudy large numbers of dijet events in neutral-currentDIS, so-called (2+1) jet events. In pQCD the cross sec-tion for hard processes in DIS is given up to orderninthe perturbative expansion inαS through the factor-ization theoremσ=order∑nq,¯q,g∑i(αS(µr)2π)k+n∫dxfa/i(x,µf)dˆσ[n]i (x,µr) ,(12.2.6)where i denotes the parton flavors in the proton PDFfa, and k corresponds to the power inαS at leadingorder. The universal proton PDFs are convoluted inx with the hard coefficients at a selected factorizationscale µf. At LO, pQCD predicts the (2+1) jet events tobe produced proportional toαS (k=1). At HERA, thisprocess is mainly initiated by a gluon inside the protonand thus dijet data provide direct access to the gluoncontent of the proton down tox∼10−3. A second LOcontribution arises from gluon radiation off one of the12.2 High- pT jets 433quark-lines in the QPM diagram and becomes domi-nant at largex.
The first measurement of (2+1) jet rates by theH1 Collaboration [3706] employed the JADE jet al-gorithm [3626], while the ZEUS Collaboration [3707]opted for a cone jet algorithm following theSnowmassconvention [3585]. The hadronization corrections werefound to be reasonably small and the measured jet pro-files could be directly related to the underlying hardprocess and the gluonic content of the proton. Theseearly data strongly supported the QCD picture of jet-production in DIS and the data were found to be welldescribedbyfirstorderQCDcalculationssupplementedwith leading-logarithmic parton showers as an approx-imation of higher-order QCD corrections. Already atthis stage a running coupling was significantly favoredover a constant value ofαS.

The inclusion of NLO QCD corrections in dijet cal-culations[3709]andanimprovedunderstandingofhadron-ization corrections of jet data together with refined andenlargeddatasets,allowedforthefirsttimethestudyofthe running of the strong coupling constant in a singleprocess using (2+1) jet rates based on the JADE al-gorithm [3710, 3711]. A summary of these results fromH1 and ZEUS in comparison to measurements ine+e−collisions is displayed in Fig. 12.2.3. The additionalpoints are determined fromΥ decays (ΓΥ), the ratioRof hadronic over total cross section (σhad/σtot), eventshapes, and the ratio of hadronic over leptonic decaywidth of the Z boson (Γhadron/Γlepton) as describedin Ref. [3712]. An insight gained from these data andfrom subsequent studies with improved NLO calcula-tions [3713] was that cone or kt jet algorithms seemto be preferred over the JADE algorithm for precisionQCD analyses due to their improved perturbative sta-bility in hadron-induced processes [172, 3714, 3715], asalready outlined in the previous section. In addition,it became apparent that the choice of suitable renor-malization and factorization scales is crucial to achievereliable results for multi-scale processes such as jet pro-duction in DIS.
Despite these first successes it became rapidly clearthat for jet measurements in the laboratory rest frametheoretical shortcomings prevent optimal comparisonsto theory. Firstly, it is highly desirable for the jet ob-servables to respect factorization, and secondly it ishighly non-trivial to separate the hadronic final statefrom the beam remnant. A way forward is found byboostingeveryeventtotheBreitframeofreference[ 3715]using the reconstructed DIS kinematics. In the Breitframe the incoming parton collides head-on with theexchangedelectroweakbosonalongthe zaxisofthisref-erence frame. Any significant transverse momentum isgenerated from QCD effects. High-pT jets primarily oc-cur in dijet topologies, for which the LO QCD diagramis ofO(α1S), whereas LO DIS or the beam remnant donot contribute. First measurements of jet cross sectionsin the Breit frame using variants of the longitudinal in-variantkt jet algorithm have been conducted by the H1and ZEUS collaborations with a distance parameter ofR = 1 .0 [3716–3718]. This choice promises high accu-racy of pQCD predictions and small non-perturbativecorrections for hadronization effects. From data at highQ2 ≳ 150 GeV2, where scale choice ambiguities are re-duced, since jet transverse momenta are of a similar sizeas the virtuality of the exchanged boson√Q2, both col-laborations determinedαS(MZ) with NLO pQCD pre-dictionsataprecisionofaround4%.TheuncertaintyinαS(MZ) was comparable to the level of the LEP exper-iments [3719] and considerably outperformed the ongo-ing experiments CDF and D0 at the Tevatron. More-over, the running ofαS could be successfully tested inthe scale range from about 7 to 50GeV. Together withinclusive neutral- and charged-current DIS data, eventhe first combined determination of the proton PDFstogether with αS(MZ) was performed from data of asingle experiment [3720].
In 1998, the beam energy of the HERA protons wasraisedto920GeV,correspondingto √s≃320 GeV.Thelarge amount of data recorded from 1998 to 2000, andduring the HERA-II running period from 2003 to 2007,led to a multitude of measurements i.a. investigatingthe dependence of jet cross sections on the type of jetalgorithm and the jet size R, or the benefits of nor-malizing to the DIS cross section. With respect to the434 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSstrong coupling constant the development culminatedin a determination ofαS(MZ) with only 0.4% of ex-perimental uncertainty [3721]. Yet, in all these QCDanalyses, the NLO scale uncertainties of roughly 5% inthe jet predictions remained the dominant uncertaintyand, hence, the limiting factor preventing a higher pre-cision for αS(MZ). The next decisive progress, then,should come from theory. After more than 15 years, thenext-to-next-to-leadingorder(NNLO)correctionstojetproduction in DIS were finally calculated in Refs. [3722,3723], which allowed to reduce the scale dependence ofthe predictions in the interpretation of the HERA jetdata.ThelatestimprovedHERA-IImeasurementswerethen the first to be confronted with the new NNLOcross section predictions, which proved the correctionsto be sizeable and could be as large as 40% at lowscales. Nevertheless, the NNLO predictions provided avery good description of the data over the entire ac-cessible kinematic range [3721] and a significant im-provement as compared to the long-standing NLO pre-dictions. This NNLO revolution for single-jet inclusivepredictions was the ultimate step to reduce the theo-retical uncertainties to a level comparable to the exper-imental uncertainties. A full analysis of all inclusive jetdata from H1 [3724], and an analysis of data from H1and ZEUS [3725] demonstrated an excellent agreementbetween the data and the NNLO pQCD predictions. Acomparison of selected inclusive jet cross section datawith NNLO predictions is displayed in Fig.12.2.5 be-low.
From inclusive jet data the value ofαS(MZ) wasfinally determined at NNLO to beαS(MZ) = 0 .1178 ±0.0015 (exp) ±0.0021 (theo)(12.2.7)with percent level experimental and theoretical uncer-tainties of similar size. Surprisingly, although jet datawere believed to have a significant sensitivity to thegluon PDF, a complete analysis of jet data togetherwithHERAinclusiveDISdataatNLO[ 3002]orNNLO[ 3043,3724, 3726] showed only little impact on the gluon den-sity.
Finally, the inclusive jet data from HERA were ableto unfold their full potential to test the running ofthe strong coupling from a single process using NNLOpQCD predictions [3724, 3725]. The results are foundto be in excellent agreement with expectations frompQCDandareshowninFig. 12.2.4,wheretheextractedvalues of αS(µr) from these data are compared addi-tionally with theαS(µr) determinations from inclusivejet data of the CMS experiment [3727] and with analy-sesusingjet-ratemeasurementsin e+e− collisions[3630,3728, 3729].

12.2.7 Highest-pT jets at the LHCFrom early exploratory up to the latest results, jet mea-surements have accumulated numerous successes: thegluon discovery at PETRA, the confirmation of thegauge structure of QCD at LEP, or the running ofthe strong coupling constant at HERA. So what is instore with the next-to-next hadron-hadron collider, theLHC? After 25 years from first concepts discussed in1984, cf. Ref. [3730], up to first collisions at the LHC in2009, and a similar timespan between the availability ofNLO calculations for jet production in hadron-hadroncollisions in 1989/1990 [3679, 3731] and the arrival ofNNLO predictions in 2017 [3362] we are now in a muchbetter position for precision comparisons. The depen-dence of the NNLO predictions on the choice of therenormalization scale is significantly reduced as com-pared to NLO. The required proton PDFs have muchsmaller uncertainties and were determined from a lotmore and more accurate data in a more systematic waythat considers and provides systematic uncertainties.12.2 High- pT jets 435The modern experiments at the LHC deliver more pre-cise data than at any other hadron-hadron collider be-fore and include correlations as well as the full decom-position of systematic uncertainties. Figure12.2.5 pro-vides an overview of data-theory comparisons for theinclusive jet cross section versus jetpT as measured atthe LHC and previous hadron colliders. Overall, the de-scription of the data at various center-of-mass energiesandcoveringmanymagnitudesininclusivejetcrosssec-tion and jetpT is excellent. Figure12.2.6 summarisessuch measurements at the LHC in the form of a to-tal inclusive jet cross section within a suitably definedfiducial phase space as a function of√s.
Despite the great success of pQCD for the descrip-tion of jet data, a few concerns in particular on thetheory side still persist. The scale dependence is justa proxy to estimate the effect of missing higher orders(MHO) and can be misleading if not combined withother insights into the process of interest like the rel-ative sizes of the higher-order corrections or the ab-sence of new process types at a given perturbative or-der. A newer approach [3755] makes use of Bayesianmodels assuming a specific behaviour of the coefficientsof the perturbative series to estimate MHO uncertain-ties with the advantage that a proper description instatistical terms like credibility intervals becomes pos-sible. Newer work in this direction can be found inRefs. [3756–3758], while Ref. [3759] follows a differenttechnique to approximately complete the perturbativeseries. With respect to PDFs this uncertainty of purelytheoretical nature only starts being considered in fitsand the corresponding uncertainties [3044, 3760, 3761].
Another point of concern, which limits the precision ofphenomenological analyses, is related to the uncertain-ties of non-perturbative effects, which are importantspecifically for small transverse momenta. Currently,they are “guesstimated” in a similar manner as PDFuncertainties 25 years ago, i.e. essentially the predic-tions by a number of MC event generators and theirmodel parameter tunes are compared without system-atic account of potential biases or correlations.
With the data from the LHC, it became possiblefor the first time to probe QCD and the running of thestrong coupling from 100GeV up to the TeV scale asshown in Fig. 12.2.4 using CMS inclusive jet data at√s = 8 TeV from Ref. [3727]. Notably, beyond 1TeVof jet pT, electroweak effects become significant andmust be considered. Also, in a search for new phe-nomena with the so-called dijet angular distributionχ = exp( |y1 −y2|) it was found that small deviationsat lowχfor dijet masses beyond 2TeV could be accom-modated by electroweak corrections [3762]. Otherwisesuch deviations from a mostly flat behaviour that is ex-pected from Rutherford-like parton-parton scatteringcould again be an indication for contact interactions asan expression of new phenomena at a scaleΛ. Similarly,excesses at large jetpT like the one by CDF discussed inSection 12.2.5 have to be considered carefully to avoidpremature conclusions on new phenomena, or, muchworse, fitting away first signs of new physics by absorb-ing them into PDFs! Again Ref. [3687] provides advice:”Note that once data is used in the PDF fit, it cannotbe used for other purposes: specifically, setting limitson possible physics beyond the standard model. In thatcase,oneshouldfitthePDFsandthenewphysicssimul-taneously.” In the latest publication on inclusive jet pro-duction at√s= 13 TeV [3747] the CMS Collaborationperformed such a fit in the framework of the effectivefield theory-improved standard model (SMEFT), wherea perturbative coefficientc1 representing potential con-tact interactions was used as a free fit parameter. It wasfound that the data are well described by the standardmodel alone and thec1 coefficient was compatible withzero. A modification of the gluon PDF as before wasnot required as shown in Fig.12.2.7. Once, it has beenassured that new LHC jet data are consistent with thestandard model, they can be used in combination withHERA data to simultaneously extract PDFs and thestrong coupling constant at NNLO toαS(MZ) = 0 .1170 ±0.0014 (exp) ±0.0011 (theo) .
(12.2.8)Also data from multiple reactions can be combined inPDF determinations as recently demonstrated by theATLAS experiment [3763]. Yet, the best results of theLHC run 2 are still to come, since the data recordedfrom 2015–2018 are still in preparation by the collabo-rations for final calibration and publication.
12.2.8 Final wordsThe presented article tries to recount the story of jetmeasurements and their relevance for QCD. Specifi-cally, we addressed what has been learned in the courseof time from the interplay between theory and measure-ment at the highest jetpT available at each momentin time. We have selected a few key measurements forthis purpose from a plethora of results achieved at thevarious colliders. For a more complete overview othersources may be consulted [3764, 3765].
For the future, of course, we expect to see moreprecise jet measurements at even higher jet pT withcorresponding studies of their impact on searches fornew phenomena, the running of the strong coupling, orthe proton structure. Before concluding, we would like436 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS110 2 103 10 [GeV]Tp1−10110210310410510610data/theoryTeV = 13s R=0.4tATLAS anti-k R=0.7tCMS anti-kTeV = 8s R=0.6tATLAS anti-k R=0.7tCMS anti-kTeV = 7s R=0.6tATLAS anti-k R=0.7tCMS anti-kTeV = 2.76s R=0.6tATLAS anti-k R=0.7tCMS anti-kTeV = 1.96s D0 midp. cone R=0.7, R=0.7t CDF midp. cone, or kTeV = 1.8sD0 cone R=0.7CDF cone R=0.7GeV = 546sCDF cone R=0.7GeV = 630sD0 cone R=0.7GeV = 300s R=1.0t H1 k R=1.0t ZEUS kGeV = 320s R=1.0t H1 k R=1.0t H1 k R=1.0t ZEUS kGeV = 200sSTAR cone R=0.4pp DISpppppQCD calculations in NNLO, aNNLO, or NLO)T,jet2+p2=Q2µ(in DIS: T,jet2=pf2µ=r2µ)=0.118 | PDF4LHC21 | Z(MsαpQCD with non-perturbative and electroweak corrections1)×(3)×(10)×(30)×(100)×(300)×(3000)×(1000)×(200000)×(8000)×(18000)×(50000)×()2GeV greater than 125 or 1502(Q)2GeV from 5.5 to 802(Q)2GeV greater than 125 or 1502(QInclusive jet productionin hadron-induced collisionsFig. 12.2.5 Ratios of cross-section measurements to predictions in perturbative QCD for inclusive jet production at central(pseudo-)rapidity as a function of the jetpT or ET. The data were taken inpp, p¯p, orepcollisions by the ATLAS, CDF, CMS, D0,H1, STAR, and ZEUS experiments, at the RHIC, HERA, Tevatron, and LHC colliders [3696, 3716, 3718, 3721, 3727, 3732–3747].
From data available for multiple jet algorithms and/or distance parameters one particular choice has been made as indicated.
The vertical error bars indicate the total experimental uncertainty of the data. The pQCD predictions are derived using thePDF4LHC21 PDF set [3748] for a value ofαS(MZ) = 0 .118 at NNLO in QCD [3362, 3463, 3722, 3723, 3725, 3749–3751] unlessindicated otherwise. The renormalization and factorization scalesµr and µf are identified withpT at hadron-hadron colliders, and√Q2 + p2T in DIS. The predictions forp¯pare only in NLO QCD supplemented with 2-loop threshold corrections (aNNLO) [3314,3752–3754], since most of the jet algorithms are IRC-unsafe. For STAR, the predictions are at NLO QCD only. The pQCDpredictions are complemented with correction factors for non-perturbative and electroweak effects where applicable.
to point out explicitly three developments that mightchange how future analyses will be performed.
First, not only gluons can be radiated in large num-bers by a (color) charge, but also photons by electriccharges. So whenever comparing electrons in the finalstate to predictions including radiative corrections, onehas to account for the effect that calorimeter cells addup the energies of e.g. an electron and all surround-ing photons hitting the same cell. To avoid a poten-tial mismatch between what experimentally is consid-ered an electron and what is calculated in theory, onecan define a cone around the electron and include allphoton-like objects into the definition of the electron.
This is then called adressed electron or, more generally,a dressed lepton, since the same concept can be appliedto muons, although the latter radiate less and are mea-sured predominantly in tracking detectors. Essentially,this is again a kind of jet algorithm, but applied to lep-tons as primary particles [3766], raising the question“What is not a jet?”.
Secondly, enormous technical progress not only al-lows us to produce jets at unprecedented transverse12.3 Vector boson + jet production 4372 4 6 8 10 12 14 [TeV]sproton-proton 510610 [pb]totjetσ Total fiducial jet cross section APPLfast + NNLOJET2.0) < |jetGeV, |y 97 >T R=0.7, pt(anti-kCMS data 3.0) < |jetGeV, |y 100 >T R=0.4, pt(anti-kATLAS data R=0.7)t, anti-kT=Hµ(NP × NNLO R=0.4)t, anti-kT=Hµ(NP × NNLOFig. 12.2.6 The total jet cross section as a function of theppcenter-of-mass energy for anti-kt jets with R = 0 .4 and 0.7.

This is espe-ciallyimportant,sincehigh- pT jetsmaynotonlybecat-egorizedintoquark-orgluon-initiatedjets,butalsointoboosted jets meaning that such jets may additionallycontain the whole decay chain of massive boosted ob-jects from either standard modelW and Z bosons, andtop quarks up to new hypothetical particles.

12.3 Vector boson + jet productionMonica DunfordMeasurements of single vector boson production in as-sociation with jets (V+jets production) play a centralrole in particle physics as they are sensitive probes toseveral different aspects of the Standard Model. WiththesemeasurementsthepredictionsofperturbativeQCDcan be tested in new regions of phase space and withsmall statistical and systematic uncertainties. In manyplaces, the experimental accuracy is better or compa-rable to that of the theoretical predictions. The studiesof W and Z boson production with additional jets aresensitive tests of the dynamics of higher-order diagramsin the QCD predictions, of models of heavy-flavor pro-duction and of parton density functions (PDFs). Thesemeasurements are used to test the accuracy of the widerange of theoretical models available. This is especiallyimportant sinceW and Z boson productions are dom-inant backgrounds to measurements and to search forNew Physics. Accurate simulations are necessary for ev-erything from the calibration of the detector to mod-eling of the signal process of interest. Measurementsof jets in V+jets production is one of the main pro-cesses used for simulation, defining event parameters438 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS(tuning), and the validation of the theoretical model.
Excellent knowledge of QCD-related variables is alsocritical for precision measurements at hadron collider,such as measurements of theW boson mass, which relyupon accurate modeling of theW boson pT spectra.
12.3.1 Results from S ¯ppS and the T evatronThe W and Z vector bosons were both discovered in1983 by the UA1 and UA2 experiments at the SuperProton Synchrotron (S¯ppS) at CERN. By today’s stan-dards, the number of vector boson events collected wasminiscule; the UA1 detector for example collected 240W →eν events and 57W →µν events at a center-of-mass energy of 0.630 TeV [3767]. The data from thesedetectors permitted first tests of QCD in vector bosonproduction. One of the immediate conclusions drawnfrom the data was that higher-order QCD correctionssuch as gluon radiation from an initial-state quark oranti-quark are needed to explain events where the vec-torboson has largea momentumin thetransverseplane(pT).
Since the dominant production of V+jets at theS¯ppS collider is due to gluon radiation from an initial-statequark or anti-quark,these eventsarean ideal sam-ple of gluon-initiated jets. UsingW+1-jet events, mea-surements of the angular distribution of the jet are con-sistent with the expected bremsstrahlung-like radiation[3767]. In addition, the spin of the gluon was measuredvia the polarization of the W boson. When a scalargluon is radiated by an incoming quark or anti-quark,the helicity of the quark will be changed since the ax-ial coupling is not conserved. In contrast, in the caseof a vector gluon which conserves helicity, the quark’shelicity will be preserved. The two cases lead to differ-ent polarizations of theW boson. Although the gluonspin was determined at PETRA [3768] and using two-jet events at UA1 [3769], this test was an importantconfirmation that the gluon has a spin of one. Finally,the value of the strong coupling (αs) was determined bymeasuring the ratio of the number ofW+1-jet eventsto W+0-jet events [3770]. Although the precision ofthese measurements could not compete with contem-porary results from electron-positron colliders [3771],they verified that the value ofαs for events where agluon is radiated in the initial state is consistent withother measurements.
The Tevatron collider, which ran at center-of-massenergies of 1.8 TeV and 1.96 TeV ushered in the eraof large data samples of W and Z boson events andof increasing sophistication of the theoretical predic-tions used to describe that data.

searches for the Higgs boson, the focus of the measure-ments shifted away from tests of the properties of QCD,such as αs measurements, to tests of the dynamics ofV+jets events. The large data samples collected by theCDF and D0 experiments allowed for measurements ofW and Z boson production with up to four associatedjets [3772]. Studies from the CDF and D0 experimentswere expanded to include, for example, measurementsof the differential cross sections as a function of thetransverse momenta and rapidities of the jets, the an-gular separation of the two highest energy jets and thetransverse momentum of theZ boson.
To describe these data, increasing sophisticated the-oretical predictions were developed. The experimentaland theoretical status at the time is nicely summarizedinFigure 12.3.1,whichcomparesanext-to-leading-order(NLO) calculation and two leading-order (LO) calcula-tions to the data. The LO calculations, which includedmultiple partons in the matrix-element calculations, areable to describe the shape of many kinematic distri-butions up to an overall normalization factor for highnumbers of associated jets but are plagued by large un-certainties. In contrast, the theoretical uncertainties forthe NLO calculation are much improved but the predic-tions do not extend over the full kinematic range of thedata. For many years this figure represented the state-of-the-art in theoretical predictions forV+jets produc-tion.
The large W and Z boson data samples producedat the Tevatron also allow detailed studies of vector12.3 Vector boson + jet production 439boson production in association with heavy-flavor jets,where heavy-flavor jets refers toc- orb-quark initiatedjets. These measurements are extremely important asthese events provided the largest background contribu-tion to measurements oft¯t production and searches ofthe Higgs boson viaWH(H →bb) production. Fromthe CDF and D0 collaborations, measurements ofWproduction in association with a charm quark andWand Z production in association with b quarks wereperformed [3772]. One most notable result is the firstmeasurement ofW+b-jets production, which was doneby the CDF collaboration, the measured cross sectionis 2.5–3.5 times larger than the various predictions withsignificance of 2.8 standard deviations. While the theo-retical predictions used in this comparison did not fullyaccount forb quarks in the initial state, this is not ex-pected to explain the difference. The data sample itselfwas too small to allow measurements of kinematic dis-tributions to resolve the source of the discrepancy.
In summary, the experiments at the S¯ppS and theTevatron colliders provided important tests of QCDtheory in V+jets production. However, the scope ofthese measurements, with the exception of Ref. [3774]focused largely on measurements of the cross sectionfor different jet multiplicities and a handful of differen-tial cross section measurements. These measurementsare important in validating QCD theory for topologieswith multiple low energy jets, where the highest jet en-ergies are not much greater than the mass of the vectorboson itself. Rare processes such asW+b-jets produc-tion were measured for the first time but the statisticalprecision of the data samples is not sufficient to probethe kinematic distributions of these events.
12.3.2 V+jets at the LHCIn V+jets production at the LHC, measurements ofjets with a transverse momentum greater than 1 TeV,which is much beyond the mass of the vector boson, arenow accessible. At these high energies, the calculationsfrom perturbative QCD suffer from large logarithmiccorrections and are themselves potentially unreliable[3775]. With the large data samples available from theLHC, we have entered an era of high precision differ-ential measurements with which we can explore QCDat higher-orders and in extreme corners of the phasespace. For the first time, we also have sufficient datasamples to measure in detail heavy-flavor productionin multiple differential distributions. All of these mea-surements also provide for better understanding of thePDFs.
In pace with the increase in data samples, a plethoraof new, more precise theoretical predictions, all withslightly different focuses, exist today forV+jets pro-duction. A more detailed summary of the available pre-dictions can be found in Refs. [3355, 3356]. In addi-tion to LO matrix-element calculations, NLO calcula-tions matched to parton shower models are now avail-able; most notable forV+jets production areSherpa,MadGraph5-aMC@NLO, MC@NLO and MEPS@NLO. NNLO calculations with next-to-next-to-leadinglogarithmic resummation and with parton showeringare available usingGENEV A. For fixed-order calcula-tions, NLO predictions to five jets or more are available,such asBlackhat-Sherpa calculations, approximateNNLO predictions for jets with up to one jet, such asLoopSim calculations and NNLO predictions, such asNjetti. Another calculation, HEJ, focuses on large ra-pidity separation and uses a resummation method togive an approximation to the hard-scattering matrixelement for jet multiplicities of two or greater; in thelimit of large rapidity separation between partons, thisapproximation becomes exact.
12.3.3 T ests of higher-ordersFor our theoretical understanding of particle physicsto keep pace with the improved accuracy of the mea-surements,theoreticalpredictionswhichincludehigher-order corrections are indispensable. Most of the mea-surements and searches performed today involve veryhigh momenta jets, leptons or large amounts of miss-ing transverse energy. In these regions, the high-ordercorrections play large and vital roles.
One important variable to test contributions fromhigher-order corrections is the observable ofHT, whichis defined as the scalar sum of transverse momenta ofthe leptons, the missing transverse energy (forW+jetsevents) and the transverse momenta of all jets passingthe selection criteria. At large values ofHT the aver-age number of associated jets in the event increases.
LO matrix-element calculations which do not providehigher-order terms drastically underestimate the aver-age jet multiplicity. Here NLO predictions are neededto fully model these distributions. These distributions,among others, have been measured for both W+jetsand Z+jets production [3776–3779]. Compared to theprevious colliders the increase in kinematic reach at theLHC is dramatic; Tevatron results reach up toHT val-ues of 500 GeV, while the LHC result extends to 2 TeV.
The necessity of high-order corrections can readilybe seen in measurements of the balance between theZ boson and the jet transverse momenta. The so-calledjet-Z balance (JZB) is defined as the difference betweenthe sum of the jetpTs (with pT > 30 GeV and rapid-ity within 2.4) and theZ boson pT.

activity is contained within the selected jets, the JZBvariable is zero. Figure12.3.2 shows the measured datafor events withpT(Z) <50 GeV compared to a LO andNLO MadGraph predictions and the GENEVA pre-dictions [3780]. As seen in the figure, the distribution isnot symmetric, with hadronic activity more dominantlypointing in the direction of theZ boson (i.e. positivevalues in this definition). The lowpT(Z) region is inter-esting: While largerZboson momenta can be describedby fixed-order calculations, small values require resum-mation of multiple soft-gluon emissions to all orders inperturbation theory [1282, 3781] (see Sections11.1 and11.2). Different pT(Z) regions therefore test differenttheoretical treatments. The NLO predictions best de-scribe the data and indicate that the NLO correctionsare important to describe not only jet emission but alsothe hadronic activity outside of it.
12.3.4 Modeling in extreme phase spacesExtremephasespaceregions,includingeventswithhigh- pTjets or high boson momenta or events with small angu-lar separation between objects in the final state, tendto be governed by a complex mixture of the numberof jets contributing to the final state and contributionsfrom QCD as well as EW processes. This makes mea-surements of this nature an ideal test bed for studyingmultiple theory approaches.
The study of V+jet production with small anglesbetween the boson and jets is one such critical test[3782–3784]. At LO,V+1-jet production is simply de-scribed by aV boson recoiling, in a back-to-back con-figuration with a jet. However, at NLO both real andvirtual contributions toV+1 jet production appear viaQCD and EW corrections. For real emissions of aVboson, either from an initial- or final-state quark, thesecontributions lead to an enhancement in productionthat is proportional toαsln2(pT,j/mV), whereαs is thestrong coupling,pT,j is the transverse momentum of thejet, andmV is the mass of theV boson. This effect be-comes largest with high transverse-momentum jets andcan be isolated by selecting events with small angu-lar separation between a jet and theV boson. In thisregion, the cancellation between real and virtual cor-rection is incomplete, making the region ideal to probe.
However, other processes such asV+2-jet productionalso play a role in this region and must be considered.
To study these effects, the ratio (so-calledrZ,j) ofthe Z boson pT to the closet-jet pT is defined. Forcollinear radiation of a Z boson, where the Z bosonis expected to have a lower transverse momentum, thisratio results in smaller values. Figure12.3.3 shows therZ,j distribution for events where the angular separa-tion, ∆R, between the jet and theZ boson is less than1.4, corresponding to the region where theZ boson hasa small angular separation from the jet (the collinearregion) [3782]. While regions with back-to-back topolo-gies(notshownhere)arebettermodeledbypredictions,the figure shows that most predictions fail to model thecollinear region.
There are many other examples of tests in extremeregions including specific tests to isolate matrix elementandpartonshowereffects[ 3785],measurementsofprob-ability of producing an additional jet in a rapidity gapof two jets [3786–3791], measurements in the forwardregion [3792, 3793] and tests of QCD with sensitivity tophysics beyond the Standard Model [3794, 3795]. All ofthese measurements are critical for understanding QCDin these difficult-to-model regions.12.3 Vector boson + jet production 4412−101−10 [pb]Z,j r / d σ d Data, stat. unc.

12.3.5 T ests of QCD emissionsAs demonstrated by the results from the UA1 and UA2experiments, radiation of additional quarks and gluonsis necessary in order to describe the events where thevector boson has a large transverse momentum. Thesehigher-order QCD corrections consist of two classes;terms with a virtual loop which do not directly affectthe bosonpT and terms with a real emission which doso but result in a jet which could be recorded by thedetector. Measurements of the V+jet cross section foreach jet multiplicity is therefore a direct test of QCDradiation. Measurements of the jet multiplicity ratiosat the Tevatron and then at the LHC showed a strik-ing feature: the ratio of then-jet cross section to the(n+ 1)-jet cross section is a constant. This implies thatthe V+jet cross section follows the formσLOV+n−jet ∼σ0e−an (12.3.1)with ais an experimentally-determined constant valuesand depends on the exact definition of the jets andσ0is representing the zero-jet exclusive cross section.
Although the constant scaling is a well establishedexperimental observation, this behavior is not a prioriexpected [3796]. Assume, for example, that the prob-ability of radiating a gluon from a quark follows thetheory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), such that)jet)+N-l+ l→\*(γ(Z/σ+1)/jet)+N-l+ l→\*(γ(Z/σ0.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.82 = 7 TeV)sData 2011 (ALPGENSHERPA + SHERPAATHLACKB(leading jet) > 150 GeVjetTpATLAS )µ 1 jet (l=e,≥)+ -l+ l→\*(γZ/-1 L dt = 4.6 fb∫ jets, R = 0.4tanti-k| < 4.4jet > 30 GeV, |yjetTp0/-1 1/0 2/1 3/2 4/3NLO / Data0.511.5 + SHERPAATHLACKB2/1 3/2 4/3 5/4 6/5MC / Data0.511.5 ALPGENjet+1/NjetN2/1 3/2 4/3 5/4 6/5MC / Data0.511.5 SHERPAFig. 12.3.4ATLAS [3797]: Measurement of the ratio of the ex-clusive n-jet and(n+ 1)-jet cross sections for events where thehighest pT jet must have an energy above 150 GeV.

The error bars indicate the statisti-cal uncertainty on the data, and the hatched bands the sta-tistical and systematic uncertainties on data. Uncertainties onthe theory predictions are statistical only except for those ofBlackhat-Sherpa.
thegluoncannotradiateanothergluon.Inthiscase,theprobability of radiating a gluon is dictated by a Poissondistribution, which implies that the cross section for ann-jet exclusive final state isσLOV+n−jet ∼¯ne−¯nn! σtot, (12.3.2)where σtot is the total cross section and¯n is the ex-pectation value of the Poisson distribution, which alsodepends on the exact definition and selection of thejets. However, the gluon follows the non-abelian QCDtheory and can radiate an additional gluon from itself.
Therefore, at higher jet multiplicities the scaling wouldbecome constant.
The observation of a constant scaling for all jet mul-tiplicitiesisinsteadasubtlecancellationoftwodifferentand opposite-sign effects. At low jet multiplicities, thePoisson scaling is present but cancelled by effects fromthe PDFs. To understand this effect, consider the case442 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSof high jet multiplicities with a cross section ratio ofn-jet events to (n+ 1) -jet events, where n is a largenumber of jets. Here, the parton momentum fraction,x, for the involved partons is similar between the twojet multiplicities and therefore any effects on the crosssection due to the PDFs essentially cancel in the ratio.
In contrast, at low jet multiplicities, the relative differ-ence inx for the involved partons between 2-jet eventsand 1-jet events is larger. Due to the steeply fallingx-distribution of the gluon PDF, this implies that theproduction of 2-jet events compared to 1-jet events issuppressed by the PDFs. Depending on the exact selec-tion criteria, this suppression cancels the increase in theproduction cross sections, which arises from the Poissonscaling.
Based on the work of Ref. [3796], the Poisson na-ture can be seen directly by selecting events with onevery energetic jet. In these events, the effect on thecross sections from the PDFs is reduced; as seen in Fig-ure 12.3.4, the jet multiplicity cross section follows theexpected Poisson distribution. This measurement is anice validation of the nature of QCD emissions fromfirst principles.
12.3.6 Differential heavy flavor resultsThe associated production of vector bosons with heavyflavor jets is an important precision test of perturba-tive QCD in the presence of two mass scales - the vec-tor boson mass and thec- orb-quark masses. Measure-ments of this nature also provide critical input to charmandstrangedistributionsinsidetheproton,asdiscussedmore in the next section. At LO, heavy-flavor produc-tion stems from either a gluon in the final state splittinginto a heavy-flavor quark-antiquark pair or a heavy-flavor quark produced in the initial state. At the Teva-tron, corrections to the cross section from the lattercontributionsaresmall,butattheLHC,theseprocessescan lead to corrections of up to 50% [3798–3801]. The-ory predictions for heavy-flavor production consist of5-flavor-scheme models, where theb-quark is includedin the PDF itself or 4-flavor-scheme models, where itis not. The two schemes, however, are equivalent if thecalculations included all orders ofαs.
WiththelargedatasamplesavailablefromtheLHC,these processes can be studied for a variety of differen-tial observables [3772, 3802–3807] and also in the for-ward region and in phase spaces with very energetic,boosted jets [3808–3811]. In general, 5-flavor-schemepredictions are better at describing the data comparedto 4-flavor ones. However, there are sizable differenceseven between predictions of a similar nature.

which is a sensitive variable to gluon splitting [3802].
The NLOSherpa simulation estimates this observablewell but fails to get the overall cross section correct (notseen in this figure). In contrast, the LO and NLOMad-Graph predictions are less able to model the shapes ofthe kinematic observables but estimate well the overallcross section. In regimes where the vector boson hasa largepT, the predictions generally perform worse; forexample they underestimate events with high m(bb) byabout half [3804]. Work is on-going to combine masslessNNLO with a massive NLO computation, with promis-ing comparisons to data [3812].
12.3.7 Probes of parton density functionsA major source of uncertainty in all hadron collidermeasurements stems from knowledge of the PDFs. Asour knowledge of QCD deepens, better knowledge ofthe PDFs are needed to continue to be sensitive to de-viations from Standard Model predictions [3000, 3001].
Deep inelastic scattering data from the HERA experi-ments provided some of the best data for PDF deter-mination over a wide range ofQ2 and x. In additionto these data, data from various experiments, such as12.4 Higgs production 443those from neutrino and hadron collider experiments.
The LHC offers a unique opportunity in that it providesa diverse set of processes, such as jet, photon, vector bo-son or top production, which can be used to constraindifferent regions with the PDFs. Today, PDFs can bedetermined at up to NNLO precision in perturbativeQCD. The input data span the range of10−5 ≲ x≲ 1and 1 ≲ Q2 ≲ 106 GeV2.
Measurements ofV+jet production are particularlyimportantsincetheseprocessescanprobe uanddquarksand also contributions froms, c and b quarks. By con-sidering vector boson processes with additional jets,the measurements are sensitive to higher values ofx,accessing x ≈0.1 −0.3 [3813], compared to inclusiveW and Z measurements. Measurements of this natureconstrain the light-quark sea at higher x as well asthe strangeness contributions and help to better un-derstand the gluon distribution at highx [3763]. TheLHCb experiment, with its precision tracking coveragein the forward region, offers new possibilities here inthat itsV+jets measurements are sensitive to PDFs atdifferent x ranges compared to the ATLAS and CMSexperiments [3792]. These measurements probe PDFsat x as low as10−4 and at highx> 0.5 [3814].
Thecontributionstotheprotonfromstrangequarkscan be probed through measurements of vector bosonproduction in association withc-quark, as was done atthe Tevatron and the LHC [3074, 3772, 3803, 3810].
In past years, whether or not strangeness contributionsare suppressed in the proton is a topic of debate, withmainly the ATLAS data preferring less suppression ascompared to neutrino scattering and CMS data. How-ever, with more data, in particular measurements ofW+jets and W + c production have provide powerfulinput on the strangeness contribution. Today, there isgeneral agreement by modern PDFs that strangeness isnot strongly suppressed at lowx but has substantialsuppression at highx.
It has been a decade long debate if the proton maycontain an ’intrinsic’ charm component in addition tothat from gluon splitting, which decreases sharply atlarge values of x [3815]. Such models, like the BHPSmodel, predict that protons would have a valence-likecharm content. Global PDF analyses are generally in-conclusive and therefore more direct probes are needed[3083, 3816]. Since intrinsic charm contributions are en-hanced in Z+jet production where the Z boson haslarge rapidity, the LHCb experiment is perfectly suitedfor these measurements [3809]. As seen in Figure12.3.6,thedataatforward Zrapiditiesfromarecent Z+cmea-surement, are consistent with an intrinsic charm contri-bution as predicted by BHPS models.

of the effect of these data within PDF fits themselves,however, is still needed.
Since their discovery in the early 1980s, theW andZ bosons are important probes to understanding QCD.
The early measurements at the S¯ppS and the Tevatronwere critical in establishing the dynamics of these pro-cesses, while at the LHC,V + jets production is nowexplored at the highest available energies. To step upwithexperimentalprecision,asuiteofversatileandpre-cise theory predictions have been developed to compareto the data. Future measurements ofV+jets produc-tion are needed to better understand QCD theory invery energetic regions of phase space, to measure elec-troweak corrections, to improve PDFs and for a betterunderstanding of heavy flavor production.
12.4 Higgs productionChiara MariottiIn July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations atthe CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) announcedthe discovery of the last missing piece of the StandardModel (SM) of elementary particles: the Higgs boson[120, 121, 3818]. The discovery arrived about 50 yearsafter theorists had postulated its existence to explainthe mechanism by which the elementary particles ac-quire mass.
The Higgs boson is the excitation of a field, calledBrout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) field. The field name comesfrom the theoreticians who first introduced the mecha-nism [38, 39, 3819]. The BEH field filled the entire uni-verse less than a picoseconds after the Big-Bang. Theelementary particles interacting with it acquire mass.444 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS [TeV] s67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 H+X) [pb] → (pp σ 2−101−10110210M(H)= 125 GeV LHC HIGGS XS WG 2016 H (N3LO QCD + NLO EW)→pp qqH (NNLO QCD + NLO EW)→pp WH (NNLO QCD + NLO EW)→pp ZH (NNLO QCD + NLO EW)→pp ttH (NLO QCD + NLO EW)→pp bbH (NNLO QCD in 5FS, NLO QCD in 4FS)→pp tH (NLO QCD, t-ch + s-ch)→pp [GeV]HM120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130Branching Ratio-410-310-210-1101LHC HIGGS XS WG 2016bbττµµccggγγZZWWγZFig. 12.4.1 (Left) Cross section for a Higgs boson of 125GeV of mass as a function of the center-of-mass energy at the LHC[3817].

Without this field the world would not be the same, asan example the electron would be massless and atomscould not be formed.
TheHiggsbosonhasuniquequantumnumbers: JPC= 0++, since the field must be the same everywhere inthespaceandshouldnotdependonthereferenceframe.
Since the time of the discovery, the ATLAS andCMS experiments have accumulated data during theRun1(2009–2012)at7and8TeVproton-protoncenter-of-mass energy and Run 2 (2015–2018) at 13 TeV. Thetwo collaborations observed the Higgs boson in numer-ous bosonic (ZZ, WW, γγ), and fermionic decay chan-nels (τ+τ−, b¯b quark), measured its mass and width,determined its spin-parity quantum numbers, and mea-sured its production cross sections in various modes(gluon-gluonfusion,vectorbosonfusion,associatedpro-duction with a W or a Z, associated production with2 top quarks). Within the uncertainties, all these ob-servations are compatible with the predictions of theSM.
Finding the Higgs boson has been very demanding.
Its production cross section is 12 orders of magnitudesmaller than the proton-proton inelastic cross sectionat LHC energies. Few hundreds of particles are pro-duced at each collision, and there can be several simul-taneous proton-proton collisions at each proton bunchcrossing (pileup). It is thus fundamental to have a verygood understanding of the resonant and non-resonanthadronic background: production of background pro-cesses via QCD interactions has to be well understoodand modeled.
Because of its large mass, the Higgs boson could notbe discovered at LEP [3820] at CERN, and because ofits very low production cross section it was very chal-lenging to observe it at the Tevatron [3821] at Fermi-lab. Only at LHC, thanks to the energy available in thecenter-of-mass, and to the exceptionally high luminos-ity, it was possible to produce it with a rate sufficientto discover it.
Precise theoretical calculations for the Higgs bosonproduction modes and decay channels have been per-formed; the results are shown in Fig.12.4.1. The dom-inant production mode at the proton-proton LHC col-lider is the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF, or pp → H) asshown in Fig.12.4.1(left), followed by the vector bosonfusion (VBF, or pp → qqH), the associated H pro-duction with vector bosons (pp →ZH,WH ), and theassociated production with two b quarks or two topquarks or just one top quark. Many groups contributedto the computation of these production cross sectionsover many years [3817, 3822–3824]. The perturbativeorder of the calculations in QCD and EW is indicatedin the figure. The thickness of the line represents theuncertainty of the calculation.
The cross section of the ggF process is known atN3LO with very good precision (5% in total, of which3% are due to missing higher order effects). The cal-culation of the higher perturbative orders in QCD, aswell as the resummation (see sections11.1 and 11.2),contribute substantially to the precision as shown inFig.12.4.2[3817].Thepartondistributionfunctions(PDFs)have been determined with very good accuracy by sev-12.4 Higgs production 445LONLONNLOLO3NNLO+NLLNNLO+NNLLLL3LO+N3NATLASCMS010203040506070/2H = m0µLHC 13 TeV=125 GeVHm Fig. 12.4.2 Calculated theoretical ggF cross-section values(blue circles) at various perturbation orders [3817].

eral groups at NNLO in QCD and reached a precision of∼2% for the gluon-gluon luminosity over a wide rangeof energy [3817].
The strength of the Standard Model Higgs bosoncoupling is proportional to the mass of the fermions,and to the mass squared of the vector bosons. Thusit will decay predominantly to the available elemen-tary particle with larger mass: for a Higgs boson ofmH = 125 GeV, the largest branching ratio (BR) is tob¯b, followed byW∗W. The various BRs have been com-puted at least at NLO precision for both QCD and EWcorrections, and are shown in Fig.12.4.1(right) [3817].
Calculation of the background processes for the var-ious Higgs boson decay channels have been and are be-ing computed with increasing precision at higher orderin perturbation theory. In parallel, experiments havedeveloped methods to estimate the various sources ofbackground in a data-driven way, not to depend on theavailabilityofMonteCarlo(MC)simulations,oronpre-cise theoretical calculations and modeling.
12.4.1 Higgs boson propertiesThe ATLAS and CMS experiments, with the data col-lected during the Run 1 and Run 2, measured with verygood precision the properties of the Higgs boson: themass is measured with a precision better than 0.2% inthe H →γγ and H →ZZ →4ℓ final states:ATLAS (H →ZZ →4ℓ final state only) [3827]:mH = 124.94 ±0.17 GeVCMS [3828]:mH = 125.38 ±0.14 GeV .

The spin and parity have been measured and foundto be compatible with the SM prediction,JP = 0 +,at > 99.9% confidence level (CL) [3830, 3831]. Thewidth of the Higgs boson has been measured to beΓH = 3.2+2.4−1.7 MeV by using off-mass-shell and on-mass-shell Higgs boson production, in final states with fourcharged leptons or 2ℓ2ν [3832], with the assumptionthat on-shell and off-shell effective couplings are thesame.
All the production modes (excepttH andbbH) havebeen observed with a significance larger than5σ, as wellas several decay channels:WW, ZZ, γγ, ττ, b¯b. A3σevidence for theµµ final state was found by the CMSexperiment [3826]. ATLAS and CMS have recently pre-sentedresultsonthesearchforthe ℓ¯ℓγfinalstate,reach-ing about3σ significance [3833, 3834].446 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSTheexperimentstestthecompatibilityoftheirmea-surements with the SM, and the results are generallypresented in two ways: by means ofsignal-strength mod-ifiers µ(definedas µ= σ×BR/(σ×BR)SM,or coupling-strength modifiers κ (defined asκ2 = σ/σSM, orκ2 =Γ/ΓSM) [3824]. Fitting the data from all productionmodesanddecaychannelswithacommonsignalstrengthµ, the experiment found the following results:ATLAS [3825]:µ= 1.05 ±0.04(th) ±0.03(exp) ±0.03(stat),CMS [3826]:µ= 1.002 ±0.036(th) ±0.033(exp) ±0.029(stat),showing a very good agreement with the SM, withinthe uncertainty. The theoretical (th) uncertainty hasdecreased by about a factor of 2 with respect to Run1,thanks to the huge effort of the theoretical community;the huge increase in statistics (i.e. 30 times more Higgsboson events), a better understanding of the detector,and more sophisticated methods (like Boosted Deci-sion Trees, Deep Neural Network and Advanced Ma-chine Learning) have helped to decrease the experimen-tal (exp) and statistical (stat) uncertainty by a factorof more than two.
For a given production and decay,i→H →f, twoparameters µi and µf are defined as µi = σi/(σi)SMand µf = BRf/(BRf)SM. Many initial states i andfinal statesf share the same coupling, e.g. VBFH pro-duction and H →VV decay both involve theHVVcoupling (V = W,Z). Another example is theH →γγ,that proceeds via a loop ofW bosons or top quarks,thus involving theHWW and Htt couplings. EachiiHand Hff coupling is multiplied by a scaling factorκ,thus defined asκ2j = σj/σjSM, or κ2j = Γj/ΓJSM. Theexperiments have presented results on theκj with thefull Run2 statistic [3825, 3826].
In the presence of new physics, new particles couldcontribute to the loops, affecting the various couplingsand modifying the SM relations. Thus an alternativefit could be performed assuming non resolved loop forthe coupling of the Higgs boson with photons or gluons,and thus assuming effective couplingsκγ and κg. Theresults are shown in Fig.12.4.4 [3825, 3826]. Moreover,in the fit the possibility of the Higgs boson decaying toinvisible particles (i.e. neutrinos or dark matter candi-dates), Binv, or to undetected particles,Bu or BUndet.
(i.e. particles that may or may not leave a trace inthe detector, and the experiments do not have dedi-cated searches looking for these) is allowed. The pres-ence of invisible or undetected decays can be inferredindirectly from a reduction in the branching fraction forSM decays or by an increase in the total Higgs bosonwidth. In this interpretation, the total width becomesΓH = ∑Γf(κ)/(1 −Binv. −Bu).
Figure 12.4.5(left) shows that indeed the Higgs bo-son couples with the fermion and boson masses as pre-dicted by the SM. The very good agreement spans overmany orders of magnitude. The results are shown forCMS [3826], and ATLAS has presented similar results[3825]. Figure12.4.5(right) shows the observed and pro-jected values resulting from the fit in theκ-frameworkin different data sets: at the time of the Higgs bosondiscovery, using the full data from LHC Run 1, in theRun2 data set (”This paper”), and the expected 1 stan-dard deviation uncertainty at the high-luminosity run(HL-LHC) for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb−1[3826].
12.4.2 Cross section measurementsWith the data collected during Run 1 and Run 2, theATLAS and CMS experiments measured the Higgs bo-son ggF production cross section with about 6% preci-sion. The total cross section measurement from ATLAS[3825] at√s= 13 TeV is50.2 ±3.0 pb, and CMS mea-sures 48.3 ±2.7 pb [3826], both in agreement with theSM prediction of48.5+1.5−1.9 pb, as shown in Fig.12.4.2.
Figure 12.4.6 shows the cross sections for differentproduction processes and the branching fractions fordifferent decay modes, as measured by the ATLAS ex-periment [3825].
12.4.3 The Simplified T emplate Cross SectionThe simplified template cross section (STXS) methodhas been developed at the Les Houches 2015 work-shop, and within the LHC Higgs Cross Section WorkingGroup [3817] with the aims to separate more cleanlymeasurement and interpretation steps in order to re-duce the theory dependencies that are folded into themeasurements (including the dependence on theoreti-cal uncertainties and on the underlying physics model).
Its primary goals are to maximize the sensitivity ofthe measurements and to minimize their theory depen-dence. The method is designed to measure cross sec-tionsseparatedintoproductionmodes(insteadofsignalstrengths), in mutually exclusive regions of phase space,and to be inclusive over Higgs boson decays, allowing toperform a global combination of all decay channels andto ease interpretation and search for BSM phenomena.

The p-value with respect to the SM prediction is 33%.
12.4.4 Differential distributionsThe large data set accumulated during the LHC Run2 allowed the experiments to do the first studies of dif-ferential distributions. A convenient set of kinematicvariables to describe the Higgs boson production inhadronic collisions, and to test QCD consists of thetransverse momentum pT, the rapidityy, and the az-imuthal angleφ. The first two variables allow to under-stand many important QCD effects. ThepT distribu-tion is sensitive to perturbative QCD, and at low valueit is strictly connected with the resummation of theleading logarithms, while at large values new physicscould manifest. The y distribution is sensitive to theparton distribution functions. At LHC the processesshould not depend onφ. Two important additional vari-ables, that probe the theoretical modeling of high-pTQCD radiations in Higgs boson production, are thenumber of jets in the event,Njet, and the transversemomentum of the leading jet,plead.jetT .
Differential distributions are usually measured un-folding the detector resolution and efficiency effects andcalculating “fiducial” cross sections. Cross sections aremeasured in a fiducial phase space, which is definedto closely match the experimental acceptance in termsof the physics object kinematics and topological eventselection. This approach is chosen in order to reducethe systematic uncertainty associated with the underly-ing model and with the extrapolation to non-measuredregions. As an example, the fiducial phase space forH → 4ℓ constitutes approximately 50% of the totalphase space. The fiducial differential cross sections arethen compared with the various MC simulations andanalytical calculations.
Figure 12.4.8 shows the differential cross section forthe processespp→H →4ℓ, pp→H →γγ, and theircombination as a function of the Higgs boson transversemomentum, its rapidity, the number of jets in the event,and the leading jetpT as measured by the ATLAS ex-periment [3835]. The data are compared with varioustheoretical predictions, all normalized to the total crosssection, where the dominant ggF contribution is calcu-lated at fixed order N3LO.448 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS4−103−102−101−101υVm V κ or υ fm f κ WtZbµτVector bosons generation fermionsrd3 generation fermionsnd2SM Higgs boson (13 TeV)-1138 fbCMS=125.38 GeVHm1−101 10 2 10Particle mass (GeV)0.60.81.01.21.4Ratio to SM0.951.001.050.40.60.81.01.21.4κ2.62.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 0.90.920.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.05W6.66.8 7 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8 0.90.920.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.05Z0.00.51.01.52.0κ2.62.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 0.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.05γ6.66.8 7 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8 0.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.05g0.00.51.01.52.0κ2.62.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 0.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.05t6.66.8 7 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8 0.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.05bDiscoveryLHC Run 1 This paper HL-LHC 0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4κ2.62.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 0.860.880.90.920.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.050.90τ6.66.8 7 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8 0.860.880.90.920.940.960.9811.021.041.060.951.001.050.90µ syst)⊕Obs.

The verticalbar on each point denotes the 68% confidence interval. The p-value for compatibility of the combined measurement and theSM prediction is 94%. Kinematic regions are defined separately for each production process, based on the jet multiplicity, thetransverse momentum of the Higgs bosonpT(H) and vector bosonspT(W) and pT(Z) and the two-jet invariant mass (mjj). TheVH-enriched and VBF-enriched regions with the respective requirements of60 120 GeVare enhanced in signal events fromVH and VBF productions, respectively.
Higgs boson tob¯b was observed during Run 2 by AT-LAS and CMS, in events where theH is produced inassociation with a vector boson, i.e. in theWH andZHproduction modes [3837, 3839]. In these events, the lep-tonic decay of the vector boson allows for efficient trig-gering and a significant reduction of the multi-jet back-ground. In addition, two identified jets coming from thehadronization ofb quarks from the Higgs boson decayare required. The dominant background processes afterthe event selection areV+jets, t¯t, single-top, dibosonprocess and multi-jets.
Benefiting from multivariate techniques (MVA) andnew machine learning algorithms, the experiments arenow developing analyses to search forH →b¯b inclu-sively in the production mode. Highly Lorentz-boostedHiggsbosonsdecayingto b¯b,recoilingagainstahadronicsystem, are reconstructed as single large-radius jets,which are identified using jet substructure algorithmsand a dedicated b tagging technique based on a deepneural network (see Sect.11.5). The jet mass is requiredto be consistent with that of the observed Higgs bo-son, and the jet transverse momentum is required tobe pT > 400 −450 GeV. The analyses are validatedusing Z → b¯b events. The measured cross section iscompatible with the SM one, but for the moment theuncertainty is still very large, i.e. around 10% [3840,3841]. Figure 12.4.10(left) shows the reconstructedb¯binvariant mass for the selectedVH events in the AT-LAS experiment [3837].
The decay branching fraction of the SM Higgs bosoninto a pair ofcquarks is slightly less than 3%. The diffi-culties to measure this channel are even larger than forthe b quark final state, because the main backgroundto cjet identification is indeed frombjets. Higgs bosoncandidates, produced in association with aW or a Zboson, are constructed from the two jets with the high-est pT, with at least one jet identified as originatingfrom ac quark. [3838, 3842].

special role in the mechanism of electroweak symme-try breaking. Deviations from the SM prediction wouldindicate the presence of physics beyond the SM. Themeasurement of the Higgs boson production rate in as-sociation with a top quark pair (t¯tH) provides a model-independent determination of the magnitude of the topquark Yukawa couplingyt. The sign ofyt is determinedfrom the associated production of a Higgs boson witha single top quark (tH). The t¯tH and tH productionchannels are studied in the case where the Higgs bosonand the top quarks subsequently decay into final stateswith several leptons (including taus, also when they de-cay hadronically), complementing dedicated studies oftheH →γγ,H →ZZ →4ℓ, andH →b¯bdecay modes.
Several MVA techniques are employed to better sepa-rate thet¯tH and tH production modes. ThettH pro-duction modes has been observed in Run 2 [3843, 3844].
The precision on the top Yukawa coupling and ont¯tHcross section measurement is presented in figures12.4.4and 12.4.6.
12.4.6 Precision Higgs boson physicsThe Higgs boson was discovered by the ATLAS andCMS experiments in 2012 at the LHC. With the datataken during the Run1 and Run2 the two experimentssuccessfully tested the SM Higgs boson. The precisionon the couplings is ranging from 3% for the coupling tothe Z, to 10% for the coupling tob¯b and t¯t, to 20-30%for the couplings to muons andZγ. Run3 and the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will deliver approximately3000 fb−1 of luminosity to each experiment. By the endof HL-LHC, rare decays channels such asH →µµ andH →Zγ will be observed and studied, the SM Higgsboson pair production is estimated to be observed witha significance of 4 to 5 standard deviations, when com-bining the results of the two experiments, as well as theHiggs boson coupling to charm quarks. As of today, theexperiments have analysed only 3% of the Higgs bosonevents that they will have at the end of LHC. By then,most of the couplings measurements will reach the 2 to3% precision, sufficient to start exploring contributionsfrom physics beyond the SM in the Higgs boson area.
A detailed discussion on the physics reach at HL-LHCis given in Sect.14.9.
12.5 Top quark physicsMarcel V os12.5.1 A brief history of the top quarkThe late 1960s and early 1970s established the quarkmodel, as described in Section1. After the discovery ofthe charm quark [75, 76] in 1974, and the bottom quark[3845] in 1977, the hunt for the sixth quark was open.
The LEP and SLC experiments could feel the effect ofradiative corrections involving the top quark in theZ-pole data collected in the 1980s and 1990s, and couldinfer limits on the top quark mass from a fit of elec-troweak precision observables [3612, 3846], but couldnot produce top quarks. Finally, in 1995, the CDF andD0 experiments at the Tevatron, Fermilab’s 1.9 TeVp¯pcollider, observed the top quark directly [3847, 3848].
The two experiments could also demonstrate the exis-tence of the electro-weak single-top-quark productionprocesses in thet−channel [3849, 3850] ands−channel[3851]. Precise measurements confirmed key SM pre-dictions, such as the forward-backward asymmetry int¯tproduction [3852] and theW-boson helicity fractions452 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS4060 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 [GeV]bbm0510152025303540Events / 10 GeV (Weighted, B-subtracted)Data =1.17)µ (b b→VH, H DibosonB-only uncertaintyATLAS -1 = 13 TeV, 139 fbs0+1+2 leptons2+3 jets, 2 b-tagsDijet mass analysisWeighted by Higgs S/B0 0. 2 0. 4 0. 6 0. 8 1Si g n al effi ci e n c y 3−1 0 2−1 0 1−1 0 1B a c k gr o u n d effi ci e n c y ( 1 3 T e V) C M S Si m ul ati o n R = 1. 5 j et s Ta nti- k | < 2. 4 η> 3 0 0 G e V, | TpP arti cl e N et bb→ v s.

in top quark decay [3853]. Last but not least, the Teva-tron legacy includes a top quark mass combination witha sub-GeV precision [3854].
The Large Hadron Collider [3855] at CERN enteredoperation in 2010 with pp runs at 7 TeV and 8 TeV.
Data taking resumed at 13 TeV in 2015, and the AT-LAS and CMS experiments had harvested 140fb−1 by2018. At the time of writing, in summer 2022, run 3 hasjust started with pp collisions at 13.6 TeV. The largecenter-of-mass energy strongly enhances the top quarkproduction cross section. In combination with the largeinstantaneous luminosity, the LHC is a genuine ”topfactory”. More than 100 milliont¯tpairs have been pro-duced in run 1 and 2 and more than 1 billion are ex-pected in future runs. The LHC therefore marks a newera in experimental top-quark physics and dominatesthe summary in this chapter.
Its properties make the top quark an ideal labora-tory for studies of the electro-weak and strong interac-tions. As the top quark mass of approximately 172 GeVexceeds that of the W-boson, the decay t → Wb iskinematically allowed and makes up nearly 100% of thebranching ratio (with sub-% fractions of top quarks de-cayingto Wd andWs intheStandardModel).Thesub-sequent W+ →l+νl and W− →l−¯νl decays of theW-boson yield an isolated charged leptonl± = e±,µ±,τ±.
These are a key signature to trigger and select eventswith top quarks at hadron colliders. The charge of thelepton furthermore reveals whether the decay corre-sponds to that of a top-quark or anti-quark, providingan efficient ”tag” for asymmetry measurements [3856].
Finally, the charged lepton is an efficient polarimeterthat enables studies of top quark polarization [3857],spin correlations [3858, 3859] and quantum entangle-ment [3860]. All these features lead to a rich and variedexperimental top quark physics programme.
12.5.2 Precise predictions for top quark physicsThe calculability of top quark production is one of thekeys to the top quark physics programme at hadroncolliders. The large top quark mass regulates perturba-tive calculations, enabling precise predictions of QCDprocesses with colored objects in the final state.
Thefullydifferentialtopquarkpairproductioncrosssection at hadron colliders is known to NNLO accuracyin the strong coupling [3339, 3396, 3861]. Electro-weakcorrections are available at NLO [3862] and NNLL re-summations are available. Predictions of the inclusivepp→t¯t production rate reach an uncertainty of 4-5%.
The uncertainty is dominated by the scale uncertain-ties, that estimate the impact of higher-order QCD cor-rections, followed closely by the PDF uncertainties.
While the NNLO calculation of top quark pair pro-duction is a major milestone, it remains a considerablechallenge to meet the experimental precision that canbe achieved at the LHC. The most precise measure-ments reach an uncertainty a bit over 2%, half that ofthepredictions.The NNLOQCD correctionshaveasiz-able impact on the shape of differential measurements,12.5 Top quark physics 453in particular on the top pt and related distributions[3396, 3861–3863]. Fully differential NNLO fixed-ordercalculations and Monte Carlo generators are required toprovide an adequate description of the data collected byATLAS [3864–3866] and CMS [3867–3870].
Associatedtopquarkproductionprocesseswithelectro-weak bosons become accessible at the LHC and providea direct probe of the top quark interactions with theHiggs boson and the neutral electro-weak gauge bosons(seeforinstanceRef.[ 3871]andreferencestherein).Thet¯tX processes at the LHC are known to NLO accuracy,and uncertainties on the inclusive production rates arewell below 10%. The experimental results for these rareprocesses are improving rapidly and already challengethe precision of the best SM predictions. ResummationtoNNLLandNLOelectroweakcorrectionsareavailable[1953, 3872] and elements of the NNLO calculations fort¯tH production are known [3873]. A complete NNLOdescription is required for allt¯tX processes to take fulladvantage of the HL-LHC programme [3874].
NLO calculations are available for2 →N processesthatincludetopquarkdecaysandoff-shelleffects[ 3875].
These provide sizable corrections for the top quark pairproductionprocessandassociatedproductionprocesses.
Predictions at the particle- and detector-level playan important role in measurements of top quark crosssections and properties and in searches for rare pro-cesses. State-of-the-art Monte Carlo generators matchNLOmatrixelementstothepartonshowerandhadroniza-tion models implemented in Pythia8 [3876] or Herwig[3877]. The work horse implementations for the LHCprogramme during run 1 and run 2 are provided bythe Powheg-box [3544, 3545, 3569], where resonance-aware matching is an important recent addition for topphysics [3878], and the MG5\_aMCNLO [3328] pack-age, that can include also NLO electroweak corrections[3330]. SHERPA [3522] offers multi-leg generation fortopquarkpairproductionandotherhigh-jet-multiplicityprocesses involving top quarks. The MINNLOps pack-age [3879,3880] providesa Monte Carlo eventgeneratorat NNLO accuracy for top quark pair production thatcan be interfaced to Parton Shower and hadronizationprogrammes.
12.5.3 Precision measurements at hadron collid-ersThe measurements of top quark production cross sec-tions in the ATLAS experiment are summarized in Fig.
12.5.1. The measurements cover four different center-of-mass energies (5, 7, 8 and 13 TeV) and span over fivedecades in production rate: fromO(1 nb) for top quarkpair production toO(10 fb) for t¯tt¯tproduction. The ex-perimental results indicated by the colored markers arecompared to the best available Standard Model predic-tions in grey.
The measurements of the production cross sectionfor the classical top quark production processes havebecome precision measurements, with the measurementof the inclusive cross section reaching 2.4% precision[3865]. The result is limited by the knowledge of theintegrated luminosity delivered by the LHC. Progressin the understanding of the luminosity calibration isexpected to reduce this uncertainty to about 1%, butthis is likely to remain the limiting factor for the mostprecise inclusive measurements.
Alsoelectro-weaksingletopproductionischaracter-ized precisely in thet-channel andtW associated pro-duction channel. With a precision of less than 7% forthe t-channel [3881], the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawamatrix elementVtb is determined as:|fLVVtb|= 1.02 ±0.04, where the uncertainty includes contributions fromexperiment and predictions andfLV is a form factor,identical to 1 in the SM, that parameterizes the possi-ble presence of anomalous left-handed vector couplings.
This result is in good agreement with the determina-tions fromb−physics [278].
TheLHCprogrammehaseclipsedtheTevatronmea-surements in nearly all processes and measurements.
However, the Tevatron legacy remains very relevant,as the different initial states (p¯p instead of pp) andcenter-of-mass energy lead to important complemen-tarities and Tevatron data continue to provide impor-tant inputs for global analyses. Several highlights of theTevatron programme remain unrivalled to this day, asthe dominance of q¯q-initiated production provides anideal laboratory for certain measurements. Good ex-amples are the study of s−channel single top quarkproduction [3851] and the measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry in t¯t production, that reacheda high significance for the SM effect at the Tevatron[3852].
12.5.4 Boosting sensitivityThe enormous sample of top quark pairs collected atthe LHC enables precise differential cross section mea-surements. Many measurements extend well into theboosted regime, where the top quark transverse momen-tum significantly exceeds the top quark mass and thecollimated hadronic top quark decays are reconstructedas a single large-radius jet.
From the first observation of boosted top quark can-didates at the start of the LHC, the study of theirproduction has come a long way. An avalanche of newtechniques has been developed [3882], from pile-up mit-454 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSt¯t tt-chantW ts-chant¯tW t¯tZ t¯tH t¯tγﬁd. ℓ+jetstγﬁd. ℓtZj 4t10−210−11101102103σ[pb]Status: June 2022ATLAS PreliminaryRun 1,2 √s = 5,7,8,13TeVTheoryLHC pp √s = 5TeVData 0.257 fb−1LHC pp √s = 7TeVData 4.5 −4.6 fb−1LHC pp √s = 8TeVData 20.2 −20.3 fb−1LHC pp √s = 13TeVData 3.2 −139 fb−1Top Quark Production Cross Section MeasurementsFig. 12.5.1 Measurements of production cross sections for processes with top quarks in the final state by the ATLAS and CMSexperiments.

igation to top tagging algorithms, and the experimentshavecarefullycharacterizedjetsubstructure[ 3883,3884]and the experimental response [3607]. With the largesamplesofboostedtopquarks,thesedevelopmentshaveenabled precise measurements of top quark interactionsin the most energetic collisions at the LHC. The mostrecent measurements of top quark pair production inthe boosted regime [3885, 3886] yield precise boundson the Wilson coefficients of theq¯qt¯t operators in theStandard Model Effective Field Theory, as the energy-growth of their impact boosts the sensitivity of thesemeasurements.
12.5.5 New rare top quark production processesThe right half of Fig.12.5.1 is devoted to the new, rareassociated top quark production processes that wereobserved by the LHC experiments in run 2. Many ofthese measurements scrutinize aspects of the StandardModel description of the top quark interactions thatwere not, or not directly, tested at previous facilities.
The associated production processes of a top quark pairwith a photon [3887, 3888] orZ-boson [3889, 3890] of-fer a new, direct probe to the neutral-current interac-tions of the top quark [3871]. These processes are well-established and differential measurements are available.
More recently, the single top production process in as-sociation with a Z-boson [3891, 3892] and a photon[3893] were observed as well. The observation of thepp→t¯tH production process [3843, 3894] confirms un-ambiguously that the heaviest SM particle indeed cou-ples to the Higgs boson. The combination of rate mea-surements in different production and decay channelsyields a robust estimate of the top-quark Yukawa cou-pling [3825, 3826]. In run 2 the first evidence was foundfor four-top-quark-production [3895]. With more dataand improved experimental techniques this process canbe observed before the end of the HL-LHC programmeand will provide a probe for the four-heavy-quark ver-tex. These rare top quark production processes providequalitatively new information on previously unprobedinteractions and form a valuable input to fits of the12.5 Top quark physics 455Standard-Model-Effective-Field-Theory parameters tocollider data.
12.5.6 New physics searches with top quarksBeyond Standard Model (BSM) searches in final stateswith top quarks have pioneered the development oftools for boosted object tagging. Thus prepared, the ex-periments have been able to take advantage of the LHCcentre-of-mass energy to push bounds on new massivestatesbeyond1TeVandinmanycasesintothemulti-TeVrange. Thet¯t resonance searches by ATLAS and CMSindicate that new narrow massive states that decay totop quark pairs or a top and bottom quark cannot havea production cross section times branching ratio greaterthan0.1pbinthemassregionfrom1.5to4-5TeV.Con-cretescenariossuchasthebulkRSKKgluon[ 3896]andW′ bosons are excluded for resonance masses around4 TeV[3897]. Searches for vector-like quarks decayingto a top quark and Higgs or gauge boson yield lowerlimits greater than 1 TeV for the mass of the vector-like quarks.
The integrated luminosity is a key for the search forflavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) interactions ofthe top quark. The branching fractions t → qX de-cays (withX = γ,Z,g,H ) are suppressed well beyondthe experimental sensitivity in the SM, but can be en-hanced toO(10−5) in several extensions [3898]. An evenlarger branching ratio BR(t → cH) ∼ 10−3 can bepresentincertaintwo-Higgs-doubletmodels[ 3899,3900].
The observation of these FCNC interactions would bean unambiguous sign of physics beyond the StandardModel.
Searches have advanced rapidly in sensitivity in run2andtheexclusionboundsinFigure 12.5.2arereachingO(10−4 −10−5), scratching the surface of the branchingratiospredictedinviablemodels.Theinclusionofsingletop production in association with a Higgs or gaugeboson have been important to improve the bounds, inparticular for the FCNC vertex with an up-quark.
12.5.7 The top quark massThe top quark mass is a fundamental parameter of theSM Lagrangian that must be determined experimen-tally. As any other quark mass, its definition generallydepends on the renormalization scheme and the valueof the renormalization scale at which it is evaluated.
The pole mass scheme is used in Monte Carlo genera-tors and many fixed-order calculations. TheMS massis extracted from the top quark pair production crosssection [3901].
Threemainclassesofmeasurementsofthetopquarkmass at hadron colliders are discussed below. A selec-tion of results obtained with each approach is presentedin the rightmost panel of Fig.12.5.2.
The first class of measurements extracts the topquark mass from the comparison of top quark pair crosssection measurements (corrected to the parton level)to SM predictions at NNLO+NNLL accuracy. The un-certainty of the mass determined from the total crosssection a 13 TeV is around 2 GeV. This includes a theo-retical uncertainty, estimated by varying the renormal-ization and factorization scales and propagating uncer-tainties from the parton distribution functions of theproton. Importantly, recent cross section measurementshave a much reduced dependence on the mass assump-tion in the correction of detector acceptance and ef-ficiency, such that in practice the dependence on theMC mass parameter can be ignored to good precision.
There is a broad consensus that this methods yields asolid measurement with a rigorous interpretation. Fu-ture progress is expected from improving fixed-ordercalculations and PDFs, and from a reduction of the lu-minosity uncertainty on the experimental side.
A more precise determination is possible based onmeasurementsofdifferentialcrosssections[ 3902].Theseenhance the mass sensitivity in e.g. the threshold re-gion. In the shape analysis of the differential cross sec-tion important uncertainties in the absolute cross sec-tion and integrated luminosity cancel, leading to a pre-cision of about 1 GeV for the most precise measure-ments [3903]. The theory uncertainty is accounted forin the same way as in the inclusive measurements andthe method retains some flexibility in the choice of themass scheme. More work is required, however, to ac-count for bound-state effects in the threshold region[3904].
Thethird,andexperimentallymostprecise,approachdetermines the mass parameter of the Monte Carlo gen-erator that yields the best fit to the observed distribu-tionoftopquarkdecayproducts.The2014combinationof Tevatron and LHC run 1 results yieldsmt = 173.3±0.8 [3905] and is used as a reference in Fig.12.5.2,indicated by the magenta area. The most precise sin-gle measurements by CDF, D0, ATLAS and CMS havesincereachedanuncertaintyofapproximately600MeV.
The results of direct mass measurements are inter-preted as the top quark pole mass. An additional un-certainty of 500 MeV is assigned to cover the ambigu-ity in this interpretation [3906]. Further theory work isneeded to improve Monte Carlo templates [3907], refinethe understanding of the Monte Carlo mass parameter[3908] and derive a quantitative relation with a field-theoretical mass scheme [3909, 3910].456 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS16−1013 −1010 −107 −104 −101 −10Branching ratioZu→tZc→tgu→tgc→tuγ→tcγ→tHu→tHc→tSM2HDM(FV) 2HDM(FC) MSSMRPV RS [9][7][8][7][6][5][6][5][4][3][4][3][2][1][2][1] ATLAS CMS 95%CL upper limits[1] ATLAS-CONF-2022-014[2] arXiv:2111.02219 [3] arXiv:2205.02537 (LH)[4] JHEP 04 (2016) 035 [5] EPJC 82 (2022) 334 (LH)[6] JHEP 02 (2017) 028 [7] ATLAS-CONF-2021-049 (LH)[8] CMS-PAS-TOP-17-017 [9] JHEP 07 (2017) 003from arXiv:1311.2028Theory predictionsATLAS+CMS PreliminaryLHCt opWG May 2022all other processes are zeroEach limit assumes that155160 165 170 175 180 185 190 [GeV]topm measurements by category July 2022top selected mdirect (Tevatron+LHC)EW fit (arXiv:1407.3792) total stat tot ± topmRef. j) differ., N(N)LOt, tt(tσ) inclusive, NNLO+NNLLt(tσdirect, NLO+PS MCATLAS, 7+8 TeV[1] -2.6+2.5172.9 CMS, 7+8 TeV[2] -1.8+1.7173.8 CMS, 13 TeV[3] -2.1+1.9169.9 ATLAS, 13 TeV[4] -2.1+2.0173.1 j, 8 TeVtATLAS, t[5] -1.0+1.2171.1 j, 13 TeVtCMS, t[6] 1.4±172.9 ATLAS, dilepton, 8 TeV[7] 1.6 ±173.2 CMS, 3D diff., 13 TeV[8] 0.8±170.5 Tevatron (1.96 TeV)[9] 0.7±174.3 Tev. + LHC (1.96-7 TeV)[10] 0.8±173.3 CMS (7+8 TeV)[11] 0.5±172.7 ATLAS (7+8 TeV)[12] 0.5±172.4 ATLAS SMT (13 TeV)[13] 0.8±174.5 CMS PL (13 TeV)[14] 0.4±171.8 [1] EPJC 74 (2014) 3109[2] JHEP 08 (2016) 029[3] EPJC 79 (2019) 368[4] EPJC 80 (2020) 528[5] JHEP 11 (2019) 150[6] arXiv:2207.02270[7] EPJC 77 (2017) 804[8] EPJC 80 (2020) 658[9] arXiv:1608.01881[10] arXiv:1403.4427[11] PRD 93 (2016) 072004[12] EPJC 79 (2019) 290[13] ATLAS-CONF-2019-46[14] CMS-PAS-TOP-20-008Fig. 12.5.2Leftmost panel: summary of the searches for FCNC interactions of the top quark with the Higgs boson, photon, gluonand Z-boson. 95% confidence limits are derived on the equivalent branching ratiot → Xu and t → Xc, and in some cases forleft-handed and right-handed couplings (left-handed couplings are assumed for the limits collected in the summary plot in thosecases).

The analysis of run 2 results is in full swing. Thelast two points in the rightmost panel of Fig.12.5.2correspond to two innovative analyses on partial run 2data. ATLAS published an analysis based on a purelyleptonic observable, the invariant mass of the systemformedbythepromptleptonfromW-decayandthesoftmuon found in theb-jet, shifting the systematic uncer-tainties from jet response to fragmentation and B-decaymodelling. A recent preliminary result by CMS [3911]based on a profile-likelihood fit reaches an uncertaintybelow 400 MeV. This result demonstrates the powerof the profile-likelihood-fit approach in top quark massmeasurements, but also emphasizes the importance of arobust uncertainty model for MC-related uncertainties.
A combination of all measurements collected can reachan experimental precision of 300 MeV.
Projections of future improvements are notoriouslyhard in this area, where a detailed understanding ofthe limitations of Monte Carlo generators is key. Directmeasurements can potentially be improved to an exper-imental precision below 200 MeV in the remainder ofthe LHC programme [3874], while cross-section-basedmass extractions can reach a total uncertainty below500 MeV [3912].
12.5.8 T op quark data in global analysesThe top quark and the results in the top quark sectorpresented in previous sections are inevitably part of the”global” interpretations of collider data. In this section,three examples are briefly discussed.
Most recent analyses of the parton density functions[3748] consider also data on top quark production113,that provide an important constraint on the high-xgluon content of the proton. The ATLAS PDF fit [3763]includes differential measurements oft¯tproduction, us-ing NNLO predictions with a fixed top quark mass. TheCMS experiment has performed a global analysis [3913]with partial run 2 data, where the top quark pole massis floated, as well as the PDFs and the strong coupling.
The analysis is based on NLO predictions for the topquarkpairproductionprocessandthresholdcorrectionsremain to be included.
Radiative effects connect electroweak precision ob-servables at theZ-pole to precise measurements ofαsand theW-boson, Higgs boson and top quark masses.
The electroweak fit (see e.g. Ref. [3914]) tests the rela-tions among these parameters predicted by the SM andforms a stringent check of the internal consistency ofthe theory. There is a very mild tension between directtop quark mass measurements and the mass inferredfrom precision electroweak data (e.g. the magenta andcyan bands in Fig.12.5.2). The main avenue towards113 To avoid absorbing potential BSM constributions to topquark production in the PDFs, care is taken to select differentialmeasurements that are less likely affected. PDF results withouttop data are available in at least one PDF set and allow forimportant cross-checks.12.5 Top quark physics 457a tighter test should focus on better measurements ofthe W-boson mass, but eventually also the precision ofmeasurements of other parameters, among which thetop quark mass, must be improved.
The legacy data from collider experiments are col-lectedintheframeworkoftheStandardModelEffectiveField Theory. Global fits of the top quark sector havebeenperformedbyseveralgroups[ 3915,3916].State-of-the-art fits include a combined analysis of Higgs, elec-troweak and top data [3917, 3918], showing an interest-inginterplaybetweenthetopandHiggssectorsthroughthe effect of operators involving top quarks in loops, forinstance ingg →H and H →γγ, through the box dia-gram contribution to di-Higgs production and throughthe associated production of top quarks and a Higgsboson.
12.5.9 OutlookA vibrant top quark physics programme was started atthe Tevatron and has culminated in a broad and richprogramme at the LHC. Direct searches in final stateswith top quarks explore the multi-TeV regime lookingfor signs of new resonances and exotic phenomena. Pre-cise measurements of the classical top quark productionprocesses and many new rare processes involving topquarks and the Higgs and gauge bosons form a power-ful set of constraints on top quark couplings. The topquark mass is known to a precision of less than 0.5%.
TheupcomingrunsoftheLHCanditshigh-luminosityupgrade are expected to improve considerably on cur-rent run 2 results [3874], increasing the precision, push-ingdifferentialmeasurementsfurtherintothehigh-energyregime, and probing ever more rare processes. Projec-tions are particularly encouraging for rare associatedproduction processes, where statistical limitations re-main important and theory predictions are currentlyonly available at NLO accuracy.
Top quark physics is an important considerationalso for a new facility in high energy physics beyondthe HL-LHC. A new electron-positron collider is identi-fied as the highest-priority installation in the European,American and Asian road maps for particle physics. Allprojects for such a Higgs/ EW/top factory envisage op-eration at and above thet¯t production threshold. Thisenables scrutiny of the top quark ine+e− collisions andprovides precision measurements of the top quark mass,with O(50MeV) precision [3919], and electroweak cou-plings, that improve by an order of magnitude com-pared to the HL-LHC projections [3920].
A new pp collider at the energy frontier can po-tentiall push the discovery reach for massive particlesby a further order of magnitude. It can also unlockultra-rare SM processes, such as six-top-production andt¯tHH. Quantitative projections remain to be made, aswell as more detailed studies of top quark reconstruc-tionin this challengingenvironment.Alsothe top quarkphysics of a multi-TeV lepton collider, be it the CLIChigh-energy stage, a muon collider or a novel instal-lation based on plasma-wakefield acceleration, remainsto be explored in detail. High-energy lepton collisions,well above 1 TeV, offer the possibility to constrain four-fermion operators with two light particles and two topquark to unprecedented precision [3921], and providean exquisite precision probe for new physics [3922].458 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS12.6 Soft QCD and elastic scatteringPer Grafstrom12.6.1 IntroductionSoft QCD has become a term covering many differenttopics.Elasticscatteringanddiffractionarecentraltop-ics associated with soft QCD but in addition there is along list of different areas associated with the term SoftQCD e.g. particle correlations, multiple parton interac-tions, particle densities, the underlying event. The listis not inclusive and could be made longer. It covers anenormous amount of different processes and conceptsand just the elastic and diffractive part represents byitself more than 30-40% of the total cross section (σtot)at high energy hadron colliders. What basically unifiesall those different processes is a large distance scale orequivalently a relative small momentum transferred inthe reaction.
Another way of expressing the same criteria is tosay that “Soft QCD” deals with processes for whichthe perturbative approach of QCD is not applicable dueto the size of the strong coupling at small momentumtransfer. This is a direct consequence of the running ofthe strong couplingαs. In this low momentum transferregime more phenomenological approaches have to beapplied. However, while using phenomenological meth-ods, the aim is always to try to provide a smooth tran-sition to harder and thus perturbative QCD processes.
Soft QCD processes have an interest in their ownrightrepresentingaparticularchallengingpartofQCD.
However, there are a number of other reasons that mo-tivate trying to achieve a better understanding of SoftQCD processes. The Soft QCD processes represent of-ten the most significant background in searches for newphysics. The so called underlying event stands for ev-erything which is produced in app collision except forthe hard scatterer. The better one understands the un-derlying event the easier it is to extract signals for newphysics. There is also the phenomena of pile-up at mod-ern colliders. In order to push the instantaneous lumi-nosity to such high values that very rare processes canbe detected, the colliders have to be operated with suchhigh bunch population that several hundreds of sepa-rate interactions occur during one and the same bunchcrossing. Most of those interactions are soft and pro-duce what is called ”pile-up” background in the differ-ent detectors and this background has to be separatedfrom the signal.
Understanding of Soft QCD processes are also im-portantinthecontextofcosmicrays.Monte-Carloeventgenerators used for simulation of the forward cascadesin air showers have to be tuned in order to extract theessential physics parameters in cosmic ray studies.
Here we will start with a discussion of elastic scat-tering and the total cross section in proton-proton col-lisions, and in a second part some other typical SoftQCD topics will be addressed. It will be impossible tocover all the topics nowadays associated with Soft QCDin this short review and we have to make a biased selec-tion. A very good and more extensive summary of SoftQCD is given in the article ”High Energy Soft QCDand Diffraction” written by V.A. Khoze, M. Ryskin andM.Taševský published in PDG [939].
12.6.2 Elastic proton-proton scattering and thetotal cross sectionFirst principlesElastic scattering is the simplest process possible at ahadron-hadron collider. Two incoming protons scatter-ing at the Interaction Point (IP) giving two outgoingprotons and nothing more. It is the most simple pro-cess possible involving strongly interacting particles butstill it can not be described directly by QCD. How-ever there are first principles or fundamental conceptswhich are relevant for elastic scattering and the totalcross section. Those principles have to be fulfilled byany theory of strong interactions and must obviouslyalso be fulfilled by QCD. Principles like unitarity, cross-ing symmetry and analyticity of the elastic scatteringamplitude are of importance. Those principles connectelastic scattering with the total cross section in differentmanners.
The most straight forward is the optical theoremthat connects the total cross section with the imagi-nary part of the scattering amplitude in the forwarddirection. The high energy form of the optical theoremcan be written:σtot = ImFel(t= 0)s , (12.6.1)where t is the four momentum squared which at highenergies can be written as -t = ( pθ)2 with p being themomentum and θ the scattering angle. The Mandel-stam variable s represents the centre of mass energysquared. The optical theorem is based upon probabil-ity conservation in the scattering process and is easilyderived using Quantum Mechanics.
The optical theorem has been used to experimen-tally determine the total cross section via measurementof the differential elastic cross section from ISR timesto LHC today. From the optical theorem one derivesthe formulaσ2tot = 16π1 + ρ2dσeldt (t= 0), (12.6.2)12.6 Soft QCD and elastic scattering 459where dσeldt (t= 0) is the elastic differential cross sectionextrapolated to t = 0 and ρ is the ratio of the real toimaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude inthe forward direction i.e.
ρ= ReFel(t= 0)ImFel(t= 0) . (12.6.3)However the optical theorem is not the only con-nection between σtot and elastic scattering. Using theconcepts of analyticity and crossing symmetry, disper-sion relations for elastic scattering can be derived. Dis-persion relations connect theρ-parameter at a certainenergy to the energy evolution ofσtot both below andabove this energy and are a very powerful tool whichplay a crucial role in the understanding of elastic scat-tering. Dispersion relations thus imply that theρ-valueat a certain energy is sensitive to the energy evolutionof σtot beyond the energy at whichρ is measured. Theρ-value is accessible experimentally and can be mea-sured by measuring elastic scattering as such small an-gles where the Coulomb amplitude starts to be signif-icant. The Coulomb amplitude is proportional to1/tand dominates in the very forward direction. The inter-ference between the Coulomb amplitude and the strongamplitude permits a measurement ofρ. Using the mea-surement of ρ and dispersion relations one can makepredictions of σtot to an energy of the order 10 timeshigher than the energy at whichρ has been measured.
This has been done several times in the past [3923,3924].
The Froissart-Martin bound [3925, 3926] is anotherexample of an important consequence derived from firstprinciples. Based upon axiomatic quantum field theoryit was shown thatσtot can not grew faster thanσtot < πm2πln2s. (12.6.4)As will be discussed in the paragraph ”The total crosssection”below,thisboundisnotveryconstraininggiventhe energy scales available today.
The Regge approach and QCDThe principles discussed above generate bounds and re-lations between important entities but do not lead toa concrete proposal for the scattering amplitude. Forthis, one still has to rely upon phenomenological ap-proaches. The phenomenology of Regge theory domi-nated the description of high energy scattering processin pre-QCD times (see for instance [3927],[3928] andreferences therein). With the advent of QCD as thetheory for strong interaction in the 70th, Regge the-ory started to loose its role. The obvious wish was ofcourse to try to derive Regge theory from QCD. Dueto the non-perturbative character of lowpT reactionsthis turned out to be extremely difficult and still todayReggeconceptsarethebasisofthephenomenologyusedto describe soft processes. However, whenever possibleone tries to connect to QCD in a smooth way.
The key concept in Regge theory is singularities ofthe amplitude in the complex angular moment plane,the so calledj-plane. The most straightforward singu-larity is a simple pole. Using this concept for a givenscattering process has as consequence that the scatter-ing amplitude in thet-channel can be be calculated us-ing an exchange of so called Regge-trajectories whichreplaces a single particle exchange. A Regge trajectorycomposes of many particles with the same quantumnumbersexceptforthespin.Theparticlesareorganisedin increasing spin with increasing mass on the trajec-tories. A trajectory is represented by the functionα(t)where α(t) is the pole position in the j-plane and isusually parameterized as a linear function oft :α(t) = α(0) + α′t. (12.6.5)The exchange of a Regge trajectory or a Reggeon leadsto a power-like growth of the amplitude withs and anexponent α(t) i.e.
A(s,t) ∝sα(t). (12.6.6)Using the optical theorem one then gets for the corre-sponding cross sectionσ∝sα(0)−1. (12.6.7)The contribution of a given Regge trajectory factor-izes in general, i.e. the amplitude is a product of twofactorsdependingonlyonthecouplingoftheexchangedobject to the scattered particles at each vertex.
At energies around 20-50 GeV, corresponding to theISRandatenergiesbelow,severaldifferentleadingReggetrajectories contribute to the amplitude. Experimen-tally it turns out that the leading trajectories inppscat-tering have an interceptα(0) ≈0.5 (see section 51 in[3929]).Thusthecorrespondingcontributionsallvanishwith increasing energy in an inverse power law accord-ing to Eqn.12.6.7. At higher energies only the so calledPomeron trajectory survives. The Pomeron carries thequantum numbers of vacuum withCP = ++ and wasproposed in the 1960s to explain the asymptotic be-haviour of the total cross section as will be discussed inthe following paragraph. The Pomeron is a good exam-ple how Regge theory connects to QCD. The Pomeronhas now been identified as a two gluon state in QCD(see e.g. references in [3930]) and some of the propertiesof the Pomeron has been derived in QCD.This will bediscussedinSect. 12.6.4.QCDalsopredictsthepossible460 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS0102030405060708090100110120130140σel (green), σinel (blue) and σtot (red) [mb]101 102 103 104 105√s [GeV]0.546 TeV0.9 TeV1.8 TeV2.76 TeV7 TeV8 TeV13 TeVσtotσinelσelpp (PDG 2010)pp (PDG 2010)Auger (+ Glauber)STAR (prelim.)ALICEATLAS/ALFATOTEMLHCbCMSσtot ﬁts by COMPETE(pre-LHC model RRPnfL2u)σel ﬁt by TOTEM(11.84 −1.617 lns + 0.1359 ln2 s)Fig. 12.6.1The total cross section for ppand ¯ppas a function ofthe center-of-mass energy.

existence of a three gluon state withCP = −−. Sucha state corresponds to a trajectory proposed in Reggetheory in the 1970s [3931], the so called Odderon. ThePomeron and the Odderon will be discussed more indetail later.
The total cross sectionIn Fig. 12.6.1 is shown all the world data of the totalpp and ¯pp-cross section from the ISR to LHC. Low en-ergy proton data from fixed target experiments are alsoshown in the figure. The total cross section starts to riseat ISR. The rise ofσtot was not at all expected. Stilltoday this rise can not be derived from first principlesand is not satisfactory solved within QCD.
At the time of the discovery of the surprising rise ofthe total cross section with increasing centter-of-massenergy, Regge theory was the relevant theory for stronginteraction. The Pomeron was thought to dominate thehigh energy behaviour ofσtot and the s-dependence wasthus given by ( see Eqn.12.6.7)σtot ∝sαP(0)−1 , (12.6.8)where αP(0) is the intercept of the Pomeron trajectory.
The intercept was believed to be exactly1 thus giving aconstant total cross section asymptotically. Later whenit was discovered thatσtot was starting to rise an in-tercept αP(0) just above 1 was introduced. Taking intoaccount the data from the SPS collider and the Teva-tron, σtot was parameterized in terms of an ”effective”Pomeron trajectoryα(t) = 1+ ∆+α′t≈1+0.08+0.25twhere tis given inGeV2 [1104]. However it was alwaysclearthatatsomeveryhighenergysuchapowergrowthin s will violate unitarity and the Froissart bound (seeEqn. 12.6.4). This problem is addressed by also con-sidering cuts in thej-plane in addition to the simplepoles. The cuts describe multi-pomeron exchanges andit turns out that those multi-pomeron exchanges tamethe growth of the total cross section and thus restoreunitarity.
Actually the possibility of a rising total cross sectionhad been outlined already by Heisenberg in 1952 [3933].
He used a very simple argument based upon the rangeof the strong interaction and the pion mass to indicatea possibility of aln2(s) rise ofσtot. This argument hadfallen into oblivion in the mid’s of the seventies. Nowit has turned out at each new collider energy thatσtotessentaily rise as ln2(s). The full line drawn in Fig.
12.6.1 represents one of manyln2(s) fit to the data. Inthis case it is one of the COMPETE parametrisations[3934]. In Regge theory such aln2(s)behaviour can onlyappear if the the singularity in thej-plane is a pole oforder 3 i.e. a triple pole.
Does theln2(s) rise mean that the Froissart-Martinbound mentioned in the previous paragraph is satu-rated? Actually we are far away from a saturation to-day.Thecoefficientinfrontof ln2(s) termintheFroissart-Martin bound is 60 mb and typicallyln2(s) fits to thedata give coefficients O(0.1 mb). Thus the bound is faraway from being saturated at today’s energies.
The rise of σtot as ln2(s) cannot be derived fromQCD today. However it is interesting to note that therehave been quite successful attempts in lattice QCD toreproduce an ln2(s) behaviour with a coefficient notso far away from the one experimentally found [3935].
There has also been attempts to generate aln2(s) be-haviour using gluon saturation in Coulor Glass Satu-ration models [3936]. This is a good example of howperturbative and non-perturbative physics meet givingan interesting result.
Elastic scatteringFigure12.6.2showsa coupleof examplesof thedifferen-tial elastic cross section and itst-dependence at differ-ent energies at the LHC. The measurements have beendone by the TOTEM collaboration [3937]. As men-tioned in the previous paragraph the Pomeron trajec-torydominatesatenergiesoftheLHC.IntermsofQCDthis means a dominance of two gluon exchange. Thegross features of thet-dependence of differential elas-tic cross section at high energies can be described interms of the Pomeron or a two gluon exchange. Thecross section falls close to exponential in the forwarddirection. This means that the Pomeron–proton cou-pling has an exponential fall off. There are small de-viations from the exponential that are not completely12.6 Soft QCD and elastic scattering 461Fig. 12.6.2The differential elastic cross section as a function ofthe four momentum transfer tfor different energies at the LHC asmeasured by the TOTEM collaboration.

understood but might at least partly be due to multi-pomeron exchanges.
The exponential fall-off parameter, often called thet-slope B, also has an energy dependence. The energydependence ofB is plotted in Fig.12.6.3. The straightline corresponds to a linear dependence inln(s)B = B0 + 2α′P ln(s). (12.6.9)This linear dependence in ln(s) is a direct conse-quence of the exchange of a Pomeron in thet-channel.
The α′P parameter represents the slope of the Pomerontrajectory αP(t) = αP(0) + α′Pt .
Ascanbeseeninthefigurethislinearrelationworkswell for energies below LHC. However at the LHC theincrease with s starts to accelerate. Also this can beexplained in terms of multi-pomeron exchanges men-tioned above [3940].
In Fig.12.6.2 is also seen that after the exponentialdecrease, the differential cross section exhibits a dipthat moves towards smallert-values when the energyincrease. In the Pomeron language this is interpretedas an interference between one pomeron exchange am-plitude and multi-pomeron exchange amplitudes mak-ing essential the imaginary part of the total amplitudedisappear at the dip. This mechanism generates a dipwhich correctly moves towards smallert-values with en-ergy.
At high values oft, beyond the dip, the cross sec-tion decreases further in a smooth way. Here one movesaway from the non-perturbative regime and instead onemight see signs of perturbative QCD. The triple gluonexchange proposed in Ref. [3941] could be a manifesta-tion of this.
The OdderonAs seen in the previous paragraphs the Pomeron playsan essential role in the description of elastic scatteringand the total cross section. The situation is very differ-ent concerning the Odderon. The Odderon is theCP =−−counter-partner of the Pomeron and contributeswith a different sign to the amplitude forpp-scatteringrelative to ¯pp-scattering. The Odderon is both contro-versial and non-controversial. It is non-controversial inthe sense that no one really doubts its existence. It isa firm prediction of QCD and represents a three gluonstate in contrast to the two gluon state of the Pomeron.
What is somewhat controversial is the size of its cou-pling and its importance in the elastic amplitude. Towhat extent the Odderon really has manifested itselfin the available experimental data is debatable (see e.gRef. [3942]) though the authors of Ref. [3943] claim adiscovery.
Experimentally there are two different signals thathave been evoked as a sign of an Odderon. The mostconvincingisprobablythedifferencebetween ¯pp-scatteringand pp-scattering observed in the dip region of elasticscattering. The¯ppdata from the D0 experiment at theTevatron at 1.96 TeV has been compared to theppdataat 2.76 TeV from the TOTEM experiment at the LHC[3943]. The dip is supposed to be filled partly by thereal part of the Odderon amplitude having a differentsign forppand ¯pp-scattering. The two distributions areshown in Fig.12.6.4. Ideally the comparisonppand ¯ppshould be done at the same energy. However, the au-thors have taken great care to compare the D0 measure-ment with TOTEM data extrapolated to the 1.96 TeV462 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERS10−210−1dσ/dt (mb/GeV2)0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1|t| (GeV2)TOTEM-D0√s= 1.96 TeVp¯p measurement by D0:central values with error barspp extrapolation by TOTEM:band center at D0 binsband width (±1 σ)Fig. 12.6.4 Comparison between the D0 ¯pp measurement at√s=1.96 TeV and the extrapolated TOTEM pp cross sectionrescaled to match the optical point of the D0 measurement.

The second possible experimental manifestation ofthe Odderon is a measurement of the TOTEM exper-iment which has measured theρ parameter at 13 TeVto beρ= 0.09 [3932]. This result is in contradiction todispersion relation calculations assuming that the stan-dard ln2(s) behaviour of σtot continues beyond LHCand assuming that the elastic amplitude only containsthe Pomeron contribution. Those calculations giveρ=0.13 −0.14 ( see Fig.12.6.5 and Ref. [3934] ) thus sig-nifcantly higher than the TOTEM result.
The TOTEM result could therefore be an indica-tion that σtot starts to grow somewhat slower beyondthe LHC energies. However an alternative explanationmight well be that the lowρ value is produced by anOdderon effect. An Odderon contribution to the ampli-tude can modify the dispersion relation calculation ina way to give a better agreement with the data. Theeffect depends on the size of the Odderon contributionFig. 12.6.6 Feynman diagrams for different diffractive topolo-gies.

at a certain energy. The so called maximal Odderon[3944] is one example that actually produces an effectagreeing with the TOTEM data.
To summarise: the measurement ofρat 13 TeV maybe an indication of the Odderon but the fact that an al-ternative explanation exists means that this signal cannot be taken as a hard proof of the Odderon.
12.6.3 DiffractionInthisarticlewehaveseparatedthediscussionofelasticscattering and diffraction but actually elastic scatteringis the dominant diffractive process. There is no uniquedefinition of diffraction, neither theoretically nor exper-imentally. A key concept when talking about diffrac-tion is rapidity gaps. For elastic scattering the size ofthe rapidity gap (a rapidity114 region void of particles)between the two outgoing protons is at its kinemati-cal limit. In general a diffractive event is characterizedby a rapidity gap which is significant larger than pos-sible fluctuations in the hadronisation process.Typicalthis means rapidity gaps bigger than 4-5 units of rapid-ity at LHC energies. Depending on the topology of therapidity gaps one talks about different types of diffrac-tive events. This is illustrated in Fig.12.6.6 where thetopologies, elastic, single dissociation and double dis-sociation are shown. Below the Feynman diagrams arealso illustrated schematically the corresponding rapid-ity distributions of the outgoing particles.
All these topologies are characterized by the ex-change of the Pomeron in the t-channel or in otherwords an exchange of a a color singlet state of two glu-ons.
114 When dealing with a particle whose mass is negligible com-pared with its energy, the pseudorapidity = -ln (tan(θ/2)) is agood approximation to the rapidity. Hereθ is the polar angleof the particle. In this article we do not make the distinctionbetween rapidity and pseudorapidity.12.6 Soft QCD and elastic scattering 463It is not always possible to map the experimentaldata directly to the different topologies seen in Fig.
12.6.6. In general it is difficult to measure diffraction athigh energy colliders, especially diffractive system witha low mass. For low mass systems a large fraction ofthe diffractively produced particles are emitted in thevery forward direction and lost in the beam pipe.
Experimentally there are two ways to select diffrac-tive events. Either to look for rapidity gaps or use socalled proton tagging. Proton tagging implies that oneor both of the two intact protons actually are detectedandmeasured.Thisrequiressmallandsophisticatedde-tectors situated as close as possible to the beam line. Inpractice, the detectors have to be placed at distancesof a mm or smaller from the beam and thus the ves-sels containing the detectors have to be integrated inthe beampipe. This technique, using so called RomanPots, was introduced by the CERN–Rome group at theISR half a century ago and is still used as the maintechnique to approach the beam [3923].
Here we will limit ourselves to discuss the simplesttopology in Fig.12.6.6, i.e. single diffraction. As an ex-ample we show in Fig. 12.6.7 the distribution of theexperimental gap size∆ηf measured by ATLAS at 7TeV for particles withpT > 200 MeV[3946]. The truegap size is∆η=∆ηf+4 in this example. The size of therapidity gap is directly related to the massMx of thediffracted system.
∆η⋍ −ln(ξx) (12.6.10)withξx = M2xs (12.6.11)The larger the rapidity gap is the smaller is the pro-duced mass.
In Fig.12.6.7 one can clearly see the difference be-tween non diffractive and diffractive events. At smallgap sizes∆ηf < 2, non diffractive events dominate andthe expected exponential decrease of the cross sectionwith increasing gap size which characterize the fluc-tuations of the hadronisation is the dominant feature.
On the other hand for gap sizes∆ηf > 3 there is arather flat plateau, which corresponds mainly to singlediffractive processes. The largest rapidity gap size binat the end of the plateau in Fig. 12.6.7 correspondsto diffractive masses larger than about 15 GeV andthus the plateau corresponds to masses above and equal15 GeV. The cross section on the plateau is roughly 1mb per unit of rapidity gap size. In the Regge theory,such type of high mass diffraction is characterized bya triple Pomeron coupling which actually predicts sucha plateau. In perturbative QCD a triple Pomeron cou-pling of the same order of magnituded is found [3947].

Measurements at masses much lower than this arevery difficult at high center of mass energies. There ex-ist measurements down to masses of 3-4 GeV but theyare scarce and often contradictory. Moreover also theo-retically the estimates of low mass diffraction are noto-rious difficult and uncertain. Actually the uncertaintiesrelated to low mass diffraction constitute the largestuncertainty of the total cross section measurements bythe TOTEM experiment using the so called luminosityindependent method which requires an estimate of thetotal inelastic cross section including low mass diffrac-tion (see e.g Ref. [3939]).
12.6.4 ”Soft” and ”hard” diffractionThis article deals with ”soft” diffraction but this is ofcourse a somewhat arbitrary classification and in thissection the concept of ”hard” diffraction will also brieflybe touched upon. A part of diffractive events has a hardscale present.The hard scale is often given by a diffrac-tively produced heavy system such as for example di-jets, W or Z bosons, or heavy quarks. With such a hardscale present, perturbative QCD is applicable. There isactually no sharp distinction between what is called”soft” diffraction and ”hard” diffraction but rather asmooth transition between the two. Often the pertur-bative approach is extended into the soft domain in agradual manner using a unified framework. This haslead to the concept of a ”soft” Pomeron and a separateand different ”hard” QCD Pomeron. This distinctionbetween different Pomerons is very likely an oversim-plification of a more complex situation.
The data seem to indicate a ”hard” Pomeron with the464 12 MEASUREMENTS AT COLLIDERSintercept α(0) ∽ 1.3 −1.5 with a small slopeα′ in con-trast to the ”effective” Pomeron which is relevant forelastic scattering and the total cross section with anintercept ofα(0) = 1 .08 and a slopeα′ = 0 .25 as men-tioned in Section12.6.2. This means that when a hardscale is involved the energy dependence is steeper rela-tive to soft diffraction (see Eqn.12.6.7). Taking diffrac-tive vector meson production at HERA as an exam-ple: the energy dependence of theγ∗p cross section forJ/ψ production corresponds to an interceptα(0) ∽ 1.4(see Refs. [3948],[3949]). Such an intercept of the hardPomeron, represented by a two gluon state, agrees withwhat has been calculated in perturbative QCD by re-summation of the leading logarithms. The small slopeα′ of the ”hard” Pomeron is also reproduced in pertur-bative QCD calculations [3950].
Hard diffraction has extensively been studied at HERAin γ∗p processes and the results have been interpretedin terms of diffractive Parton Distribution Functionsof the Pomeron and a Pomeron flux factor based uponReggetheory[ 3570].ItwasshownwithinQCDthatfac-torization is valid for diffractive hard scattering inγ∗pprocesses [3951]. However, using the same formalismand using the DPDF’s determined at HERA fromγ∗pprocesses applied to¯ppprocesses at the Tevatron givesabout an order of magnitude too high cross section forQCD jet production (see e.g. [3952]). At the Tevatronthe process is completely hadronic, and the reduction ofthe cross section is thought to be due to the fact thatsometimes the rapidity gap is filled or partially filledby hadron remnants which are not present inγ∗p pro-cesses. In this case, the factorisation using diffractiveDPDF’s suggested by the HERA data breaks down.
12.6.5 The Underlying EventThe underlying event is not to be confused with Min-imum Bias Events. As the name indicates, minimumbias events are events collected with as little bias aspossible. The concept of Underlying Event (UE) is dif-ferent. Here one refers to events that contain a hardparton-partoninteractionandthetermunderlyingeventrefers to all the activity that accompanies the hard scat-ter but is not a part of it. The Underlying Event hasseveral different components. There are contributionsfrom initial and final-state interaction but also particlesfrom the proton break-up so called beam–beam rem-nants contribute. An important part of the UnderlyingEvents consists of Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI)i.e. two or more soft or semi hard interactions withinthe samepp interaction. In Fig.12.6.8 a typical UE isshown in schematized way.

A good description of the UE is needed to extractthe relevant signals from the hard scatter and rely uponMC generators which are based upon different phe-nomenological approaches. Many input parameters inthe MC generators parameters have to be tuned withdata. To get information relevant for the UE the eventis often divided into different regions of the phase spaceas indicated in Fig.12.6.9. Normally a ”transverse” re-gion is defined relative to the azimuthal angle of theleading pT particle. This region is then taken as the ref-erence region for the underlying event. In Fig.12.6.10is shown an example of the mean charged-particle mul-tiplicity as a function of the leadingpT for the differentregions around the leading particle [3953]. All regionsexhibit a fast rise at lowpT up to apT of about 5 GeV.
Here there are no real ”hard” processes and we see therise of activity due to the increase of MPI. At higherpT, hard processes start to dominate and the transverseregion which is decoupled from the hard scatter reacha plateau.
12.6.6 Charged particle densityThe charged particle density as a function of rapidityis an important observable inpp collisions. The mea-surement covering the largest rapidity interval has beendone by a combination of CMS and TOTEM at theLHC [3954, 3955]. The result of their measurement isshown in Fig.12.6.11.
To describe the entire rapidity interval models mustbe able to combine and connect perturbative QCD withnon-perturbative approaches. The experimental pointsare compared to a number of different models whichare available. The approaches are different but thereare also several common elements in the models. Ascan be seen the gross features of the distribution arereasonably well described by the models.
The density atη = 0 as a function of the centre ofmass energy has been plotted in Fig.12.6.12 using datafrom the Sp¯pS collider and the Tevatron in addition tothe LHC data [3955]. The data points have been fitted12.6 Soft QCD and elastic scattering 465Fig. 12.6.9 Definition of regions in the azimuthal angle withrespect to the leading (highest- pT) charged particle, with arrowsrepresenting particles associated with the hard scattering processand the leading charged particle highlighted in red. Conceptually,the presence of a hard-scatter particle on the right-hand side of thetransverse region, increasing its ΣpT, typically leads to that sidebeing identified as the “trans-max” and hence the left-hand sideas the “trans-min”, with maximum sensitivity to the UE.

with a power law. It is interesting to note that the in-crease of the density atη= 0 is faster than the increaseof the total cross section with energy. This can be un-derstood in terms of Pomeron interaction. To calculatean inclusive cross section like the density atη = 0 itis enough to use a one-pomeron exchange diagram. Forthe total cross section on the other hand one has to takeFig. 12.6.11 Charged particle pseudorapidity distributions ob-tained in ppcollisions at √s= 8 TeV for inelastic events as mea-sured by the CMS and TOTEM experiments.

12.6.7 ConclusionAs mentioned in the introduction “soft” processes covera large part of the total cross section. Collider exper-iments, at HERA and the Tevatron and now also atLHC, have produced a large amount of measurementsrelated to lowpT reactions. The large rapidity coverageof the LHC detectors, and dedicated small angle ex-periments such as TOTEM, have offered new possibili-ties and there is still more to come. Moreover, the high
