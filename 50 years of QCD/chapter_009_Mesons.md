An intriguing finding is that the system seems to re-store the conformality quite rapidly as first quantifiedinRef. [2247]. ThepQCD resultsat asymptotically highdensity as indicated in Fig. 7.2.8 are nearly confor-mal because the density scale is sufficiently larger thanΛQCD and the system is weakly interacting. Thus, theNS experimental data imply the realization of stronglycorrelated conformal matter far earlier at not asymp-totically high but just intermediate density. The micro-scopic origin of early conformality is to be identified byfuture studies.
Finally, let us briefly mention the impact of thegravitational wave signal from the NS merger. So far,the LIGO-Virgo collaboration reported two events ofGW170817 and GW190425 as candidates of the NS-NSmerger. In particular the former happened at a shortdistance of only 40Mpc, and the electromagnetic coun-terpart (called the “kilonova”) was also detected. Forthe moment only the signal from the inspiral stage be-fore the merger has led to an EOS constraint in termsof the tidal deformability coefficient [2248, 2249], whichturned out to be consistent with preceding constraintsfrom the symmetry energy measurement [2250] as wellas the NS mass-radius distributions. In the future thepost-merger stage after the merger might be detected,and if so, an extremely dense state of matter, evendenser than the largest density in the central core ofthe NS, could be probed, which will eventually clarifythe nature of Quarkyonic Regime, quark matter, andhopefully color-superconducting states.
8 MesonsConveners:Eberhard Klempt and Curtis MeyerThe Particle Data Group lists 78 light mesons withuand d quarks, 50 of them are “established”, with 3\* or4\* ratings. 25 mesons carry strangeness, 16 of them areestablished. Most mesons show a regular pattern, theirmasses are mostly compatible with a Regge behaviorin L and N. Curtis Meyer introduces the meson quan-tum numbers and their regularities. The scalar mesonsof lowest mass have resisted for a long time an undis-puted acceptance with proper poles in the complex en-ergy plane. José Pelaez shows how unitarity, analyticityand dispersion relations are exploited to determine thescalar partial wave and to extract the poles with highprecision. A driving force in meson spectroscopy is sincelong the quest for hybrids, in particular those with ex-otic quantum numbers, and for glueballs. Boris Grubeand Eberhard Klempt present old and recent evidencefor these states. 12 (7) established (candidate) charmedmesons are known at present, 7 (5) mesons with a bot-tom and a light quark, 6 (5) with a strange and 2 with acharm quark. Charmonium (and bottomonium) playeda crucial role for the general acceptance of the quarkmodel.Nowadays,39 c¯cstatesareknown,25ofthemes-tablished. The so-called XYZ states, unexpected statesor states with unexpected properties, play an impor-tant role to understand the richness of QCD. MarcoPappagallo reports on the crime story ofX(3872) withits dual nature, on the unexpected Y(4260) and thediscovery of Z+c (4430) and Tcc(3875), both with min-imal four-quark content. Nora Brambilla outlines thedifferent approaches to identify the degrees of freedomdriving the exotic states.
8.1 The meson mass spectrum, a surveyCurtis Meyer8.1.1 IntroductionInthequarkmodel,mesonsarestatescontainingquarks,antiquarks and gluons such that the net baryon numberof the state is zero. Conventional mesons are describedas bound states of a quarks and an antiquark (q¯q) andcan be viewed as similar to positronium (e+e−). Exoticmesons can include hybrids, which areq¯qg states withvalence glue, four-quark states containing two quarksand two antiquarks, and glueballs containing only glue.
These more exotic forms will be discussed in later sec-tions, this section will deal with the ordinary mesons,8.1 The meson mass spectrum, a survey 261referred to here as simply mesons. Mesons containingonly u, dand squarks are known aslight-quark mesons.
Given three quarks and three antiquarks, nine possibleq¯q combinations can be made. These nine mesons forma so-called nonet where the members have the samewell-defined quantum numbers: total spinJ, parityP,and C-parityC, represented asJPC.
8.1.2 Meson Quantum NumbersTheJPC quantumnumbersofquark-antiquarksystemsare functions of the total spin,S, and the relative or-bital angular momentum,L. The spin S and angularmomentum L combine to yield the total spinJ,⃗J = ⃗L⊕⃗S, (8.1.1)where L and S add as two angular momenta.
Parity is the result of a mirror reflection of the wavefunction, taking⃗ rinto −⃗ r. It can be written asP[ψ(⃗ r)] = ψ(−⃗ r) = ηPψ(⃗ r) , (8.1.2)where ηP is the eigenvalue of parity. As application ofparity twice must return the original state,ηP = ±1.
In spherical coordinates, the parity operation reducesto the reflection of aYLM function,YLM(π−θ,π + φ) = ( −1)LYLM(θ,φ) . (8.1.3)From this, we conclude thatηP = (−1)L. For aq¯q sys-tem, the intrinsic parity of the antiquark is opposite tothat of the quark, which yields the total parity of aq¯qsystem asP(q¯q) = −(−1)L. (8.1.4)Charge conjugation, C, is the result of a transfor-mation that takes a particle into its antiparticle. For aq¯q system, only electrically-neutral states can be eigen-states ofC. In order to determine the eigenvalues ofC(ηC), we need to consider a wave function that includesboth spatial and spin informationΨ(⃗ r,⃗ s) = R(r)Ylm(θ,φ)χ(⃗ s) . (8.1.5)If we consider au¯usystem, theC operator reverses themeaning of u and ¯u which has the effect of mappingthe vector ⃗ rto the u quark into −⃗ r. Thus, followingthe arguments for parity, the spatial part ofC yields afactor of (−1)L. The C operator also reverses the twoindividualspins.Forasymmetric χ,wegetafactorof 1,while for an antisymmetricχ, we get a factor of−1. Fortwo spin-12 particles, theS = 0 singlet is antisymmetric,while the S = 1 triplet is symmetric. Finally, there isan additional factor of −1 when we interchange twofermions. Combining all of this, we find that the C-parity of (a neutral)q¯q system isC(q¯q) = ( −1)L+S. (8.1.6)Table 8.1.1 The allowed JPC quantum numbers for light-quark mesons withLup to4.

From the list, theJPCvalues of 0−−, 0+−, 1−+, 2+− and 3+− are missing.
These missingJPC are referred to asexotic.
Because C-parity is only defined for neutral meson,we define G-parity to extend this to all non-strangeq¯q states, independent of charge. For isovector states(I = 1), C would transform a charged member into theoppositely charged state (e.g. π+ →π−). In order totransform this back to the original charge, we wouldneed to perform a rotation in isospin (π− →π+). Fora state of whose neutral partner hasC-parity C, andwhose total isospin isI, theG-parity is defined to beG= C·(−1)I , (8.1.7)which can be generalized toG(q¯q) = ( −1)L+S+I . (8.1.8)The latter is valid for all of theI = 0 and I = 1 non-strange members of a nonet. In the limit of exact SU(3)symmetry, G is conserved. Mesons withG= +1 decayintoanevennumberofpionswhilemesonswith G= −1decay into an odd number of pions. From this, mesonshave the following well defined quantum numbers: totalangular momentumJ, isospinI, parityP, C-parityC,and G-parityG. These are represented as(IG)JPC, orsimply JPC for short. For the case ofL= 0 and S = 0,we have JPC = 0 −+, while for L = 0 and S = 1 ,JPC = 1−−.
8.1.3 Light-quark meson namesPrior to 1986, there was no systematic naming schemefor mesons. Those who discovered new states often pro-posed what those states would be called. In 1986, theParticle Data Group [2251] proposed a naming schemefor mesons that is still in use today. This scheme isbased on the total spinJ, parityP and charge conju-gation C of the nonet, and then the isospin of the nonet262 8 MESONSTable 8.1.2The naming scheme for light-quark mesons [939].

The SU(3) singlet state also hasI = 0 . The SU(3)singlet state withI = 0 is|1⟩= 1√3(u¯u+ d¯d+ s¯s), (8.1.9)while the SU(3) octet state withI = 0 is|8⟩= 1√6(u¯u+ d¯d−2 s¯s). (8.1.10)The two physicalI = 0 states are mixtures of the twoSU(3) states. Following the Particle Data Group [939]notationwithnonetmixingangle θn,thephysicalisospin-zero states are(ff′)=( cos θn sin θn−sin θn cos θn)( |1⟩|8⟩). (8.1.11)Many of the known nonets have physical states thatseparate the light-quark states,u¯u+ d¯d, and the stateswith hidden strangeness,s¯s. This is known as ideal mix-ing and corresponds totan θn = 1√2 , or θn ≈35.26◦.
Contrary to this, the ground state mesons are almostpure SU(3) states. Theη′ is nearly pure singlet and theη is the octet state. The nonet mixing angles can bedetermined from masses of the member states. In thefollowing, ma is the mass of the isospin1 state, mKis the mass of the isospin-12 , and mf and mf′ are themasses of the two isospin-0 states. θ in equation8.1.12is known as the linear mixing angle,tan θ = 4mK −ma −3mf′2√2 (ma −mK) (8.1.12)while equation8.1.13 is known to define the quadraticmixing angle.

The mixing angles can also be determined using relativedecay rates for the physical isospin0 states to pairs ofmesons in the same nonets, to two pseudoscalar mesons,or to a pseudoscalar and a vectorJPC = 1 −− meson.
Determinations exploiting decay rates exist for severalnonets [2252]. In Table8.1.4 are listed the lattice QCDpredictions as well as several determinations of mixingangles from decay measurements. The one discrepancybetween lattice and decay rate predictions are in the2−+ nonet; this may be due to incorrect assignmentsand is discussed later.
8.1.5 Light-quark mesonsThe pseudoscalar mesonsThe JPC = 0−+ mesons are spin singlets with0 orbitalangular momentum and are known as the pseudoscalarmesons. They are listed in Table8.1.5. These are thelightest mesons, and with the exception of theη′, alltheir decays are either weak or electromagnetic. In ad-dition, the mixing of this nonet is quite different fromother nonets in that the mixing angle is small, and theη and η′ are very close to being SU(3) octet and singletstates respectively.
Inadditiontothegroundstatepseudoscalarmesons,there can also be radially excited states. Both excitedπs, the π(1300) and π(1800), and ηs, the η(1295), theη(1405), the η(1475), η(1760) and the η(2225) havebeen observed. TheK(1460) and K(1830) are the ob-served JP = 0 − states. The lighter is consistent withTable 8.1.5The pseudoscalar mesons.

One could alsoassociate the π(1800), η(1760) and K(1830) togetheras a third nonet as listed in Table8.1.7. However inadditon to the second radial excitation, there is a pre-dicted pseudoscalar glueball (see Section8.4) as well asa nonet ofJPC = 0−+ hybrid mesons (see Section8.3).
With regard to theη(1295) state, we believe that itsstatus deserves some scrutiny and that theη(1405) andη(1475) shouldbethetwo I = 0 membersoftheradiallyexcited pseudoscalar mesons. For theη(1295), there isa single report in radiativeJ/ψ decays [2257, 2258], butthere is ambiguity about whether the signal isη(1295)or f1(1285). It has not been reported in otherJ/ψ mea-surements since then, while there has been extensiveresults of theη′, η(1405) and η(1475). The majority ofthe observations have been in pion production [2259–2263] where there are generally contributions from boththe η(1295) and thef1(1285). Inp¯p annihilation, boththe η(1405) [2264] and the η(1475) [2265] have beenobserved, but no observation of theη(1295) has beenreported.

The dominant decaymodes of the vector mesons are through the strong in-teraction to two or three pseudoscalar mesons and thestates are nearly ideally mixed with theω nearly allu¯uand d¯d, while theφ is nearly alls¯s.
In addition to the expected radial excitations of thevector mesons, theL = 2 , S = 1 q¯q system can alsohave JPC = 1 −−. Finally, there is a nonet of hybridmesons expected with the sameJPC. Thus, we expectdisentangling of the excited vector meson spectrum tobe tricky. The reported states inI = 1 are ρ(1450),ρ(1570), ρ(1700), ρ(1900) and ρ(2150). In the I = 0system, ω(1420), ω(1680), φ(1680) and φ(2170) havebeen reported. Finally, for I = 12 , the K∗(1410) andK∗(1680) are known. The Particle Data Group iden-tifies the radially excited states as in Table8.1.9. Thestates identified with the D-wave nonet are listed in Ta-ble 8.1.16 and discussed later.

Because ofthis, the two states can mix, and it is believed that thephysical states, K1(1270) and K1(1400), are mixturesof the SU(3) states,K1A and K1B, with a mixing angleθK1 = −(33.6 ±4.3)◦ [2267] conventionally defined by(|K1(1270)⟩|K1(1400)⟩)=(sin θK1 cos θK1cos θK1 −sin θK1)( |K1A⟩|K1B⟩).
The scalar mesonsA spin triplet withL= 1 can form three possibleJPCs:0++, 1++ and 2++. The0++ states are known as scalarmesons and are discussed in Section8.2 because thereare added complications which make it difficult to dis-cuss them with the other mesons. There is also signif-icant discussion of the scalar states and their relationto the scalar glueball, see Section8.4).
The axial vector mesonsThe L = 1 JPC = 1 ++ mesons are known as the ax-ial vector mesons and are listed in Table 8.1.12. Asnoted earlier in the discussion of the pseudo vectormesons, the SU(3)K1B state is a mixture of the phys-ical K1(1270) and K1(1400) states. In addition to thestates listed, two additional states have been reported.
The f1(1510) has been seen in kaon production [2268,2269] as well as pion production [2270] decaying toK∗K. These productions and decay would favor ans¯sinterpretation of the f1(1510), but it is probably toolight to be the radial excitation. A second state, thea1(1640) is identified as the radial excitation of thea1(1270). This has been observed in pion productionwiththemostsignificantobservationinreference[ 2271].
It has also been reported inD decays [2272].8.1 The meson mass spectrum, a survey 265Table 8.1.13The tensor mesons.

Thiswell-established nonet is close to ideally mixed as notedin Table8.1.3. As with the vector mesons, there is a sec-ond L, S combination that can exist forJPC = 2 ++,L= 3 and S = 1 . In addition, one of the lightest glue-balls is also expected to have these quantum numbers,and of course radial excitations should be present.
With regard to excited states, there is a seconda2state, thea2(1700), which the Particle Data Group as-sociates with the radial excitation of the tensor mesons.
This assignment is based on mass, where we would ex-pect the radial a2 state to be close in mass to thea1(1640), the radial excitation of thea1. The L = 3state is expected to have similar mass to otherL = 3states, where here the a4(1970) anchors these nonetaround 2GeV. Thea2(1700) has been observed in manyproductionmechanismsincludingpionproduction[ 2271,2273–2276],p¯pannihilation[2277–2280],two-photonpro-duction [2281, 2282] andψ′ radiative decays [2283].
For the isospin 0 states, there is an overpopula-tion off2 states, with10 additional states beyond thetwo ground state tensors reported. These include thef2(1430),f2(1565),f2(1640),f2(1810),f2(1910),f2(1950),f2(2010), f2(2150), f2(2300) and f2(2340). ForI = 12 ,there is a single state, theK∗2 (1980). The Particle DataGroup identifies the radially excited states as listed inTable8.1.14. With the radial states accounting for2 ofthe 10 extra states, a second pair in theL= 4 mesons,probably above 2GeV in mass, and a glueball state,there are still 5 states. Presumably several of the re-ported states are all the same state, with low statis-tics and differences in production mechanisms account-ing for the differences.

This interpretation is supported by arecent analysis of BESIII data on radiativeJ/ψ decays(see Section8.4). In any case, a careful examination ofthe I = 0 JPC = 2 ++ data with high statistics experi-ments is merited.
The pseudo tensor mesonsMesons formed withS = 0 and L= 2 haveJPC = 2−+and are known as the pseudo tensor mesons. The knownstates are listed in Table8.1.15. In addition to the ra-dial excitations of these states, there is also a nonet ofhybrid mesons expected. The latter are likely slightlyheavierthanthemesonsinTable 8.1.15.Therearethreeknown states beyond those in the table, theπ2(1880),π2(2005) and the π2(2100). It is also interesting thatthe decay patterns of the η2(1645) and the η2(1870)both look like those for au¯u/d¯d state and not ans¯sstate [2285]. This suggests that theη2(1870) might bepaired with the π2(1880) in a third nonet. However,studies of the axial anomaly [2252] favor the assignmentin Table8.1.15, but with an unusual mixing angle thatis inconsistent with lattice, as shown in Table8.1.4.
The D-state vector mesonsThe mesons formed from anS = 1,L= 2 q¯qsystem canhave JPC = 1 −−, 2−− and 3−− and are referred to asvector mesons. The Particle Data Group identifies thestates listed in Table8.1.16 with the1−− states, wherethere is no candidate for theφ state which is probablyexpected with a mass in the1.8 to 1.9GeV mass region.
For the JPC = 2 −− states, very little is known withthe only assignment made by the Particle Data Groupbeing the K2(1820). However, similar to theK1A andK1B of the1+− and 1++ nonets, the kaonic states fromthe 2−+ and 2−− nonets can also mix.266 8 MESONSTable 8.1.17 The L= 2 3 −− vector mesons.

These states are listed in Table8.1.17. In addition tothe listed states, there are two additionalρ3 states re-ported in literature. Theρ3(1990) is reported inp¯pan-nihilation [2286, 2287], and the ρ3(2250) reported inboth ¯ppannihilation and inψ′ decays [2286, 2288]. Thelighter state could be a radial excitation of theL = 2ρ3(1690). The higher mass state is of similar mass tothe ρ5(2350) and could be anL= 4 meson.
Higher excitationsGoing beyond theL= 2 mesons, less is known, with themost information tending to be on the nonets with thelargest J. For the case ofL = 3 , there are candidatesfor the JPC = 4 ++ mesons as shown in Table8.1.18.
There should also be a2++ and 3++ nonet as well asa JPC = 3 +− nonet. While as noted in the tensor me-son section, there are a large number of reportedf2states, in particular the f2(2010), f2(2150), f2(2300)and f2(2340), assigning any of these to anL= 3 nonetis not clear. There is also aJP = 3 + kaonic state, theK3(2320) which could be a member of either of the spin3 nonets.
For theL = 4 mesons, the highest spin isJPC =5−−, and a few states with these quantum numbers areknown, as listed in Table8.1.19.

In reality, the trajec-tories are often more complicated than the simple linearform. In a simplified picture when the quarks can be re-garded as ultrarelativistic, a linear confining potentialleads to linear Regge trajectories, while in the nonrela-tivistic regime, the trajectories would be nonlinear, andthe intermediate regime would lead to a transition inthe slope of the Regge trajectories. In the ultrarela-tivistic regime, the Regge slope depends on the stringtension, while more generally it depends on both thequark masses and the tension. See reference [2289] fora more detailed discussion on this. In addition to thetrajectories in orbital angular momentuml, there arealso trajectories in the radial excitation quantum num-ber, n. From a simple linear confining potential withstring tensionσ, the orbital trajectory is given in equa-tion 8.1.14 and the radial as in equation8.1.15, whereone would expect universal slopes in both cases, withthe slopes related by a factor ofπ2 .
M2 = 8 σl+ c1 , (8.1.14)M2 = 4 πσn+ c2 . (8.1.15)For light-quark mesons, the slopes are similar, butnot universal. The orbital trajectories starting with thepseudoscalar mesons are shown in Fig.8.1.2. The slopesfor the two are found to be 1.20GeV2 and 1.37GeV2respectively. The orbital trajectories starting with thevector mesons are shown in Fig.8.1.3. In these cases,the slopes are found to be 1.10GeV2 and 1.09GeV2respectively.
76 Seeparagraph The Regge approach and QCD inSection 12.6for an introduction to Regge phenomenolgy8.2 The light scalarsJosé R. Peláez8.2.1 IntroductionLight scalar mesons are treated in a separate subsectionbecause, on the one hand, both their existence and na-ture have been the subject of a six-decade-long debatethat predates QCD. On the other hand, they are par-ticularly interesting because they play a very relevantrole in several aspects, gathered below in seven itemsfor concreteness, some of them already present beforeQCD, some others after.
First of all, in 1955, well before QCD was formu-lated, Johnson and Teller [2291] proposed the existenceof a light scalar-isoscalar field to explain the attractivepartofthenucleon-nucleoninteraction.Twoyearslater,Schwinger suggested that such a field, which he namedσ, could be an isospin singlet, difficult to observe dueto its huge width caused by its most likely very strongcoupling to two pions.
Second, in the early sixties, Gell-Mann and Levy[2292] considered this field as the fourth member of amultiplet together with the three pions to build thepopular “Linear sigma model” (LσM). Such a statecould also be generated dynamically in the Nambu andJona-Lasinio (NJL) models [54, 2209]. These relativelysimple models were able to explain the light masses ofthe pions, kaons and eta, and their mass gap with re-spect to the other hadrons, since they are the Nambu-Goldstone Bosons (NGB) of a spontaneous chiral sym-metrybreakingobservedinthespectrum.Actually,theyarepseudo-NGB,becausetheyarenotstrictlymassless.
The masses of light-scalar mesons are closely relatedto the size of the non-zero vacuum expectation value,particularly those that share its same quantum num-bers. Details of their interactions are also related to thespecifics of the spontaneous breaking mechanism. Theconsequences of chiral symmetry were initially workedout with current-algebra methods as described in Sec-tion 1. Of particular interest for us will be the deriva-tive interactions of NGB among themselves and the re-quirement of an Adler-zero below threshold in the NGBscattering amplitudes [20]. The leading order at low en-ergies of those amplitudes was obtained by Weinberg in[22].
Third, since light scalars are the lightest states inthe QCD spectrum that are not pseudo-NGB, we mayexpect them to fit as ordinary quark-antiquark mesonswithin the Quark Model that was proposed in the mid60’s [17, 18]. However, they do not, as we will see re-peatedly below. Moreover, within the Quark Model, an-other scalar strange state, relatively similar to theσ268 8 MESONSand called κ, was proposed by Dalitz in 1965 [2293],with a quark-antiquark assignment in a simple poten-tial model, or more generally “simply on the basis ofSU(3) symmetry”. The existence of these two states,the σ and κ, nowadays known asf0(500) and K∗0 (700),has been very controversial until very recently, becausethey are extremely wide and difficult to observe. Actu-ally, since they were first proposed, there were many ex-perimental and phenomenological claims of such states,sometimes narrow, sometimes wide, sometimes lighterthan 1 GeV, sometimes heavier and sometimes absent.
The list of references is huge and we refer the readerto the Review of Particle Properties (RPP) [939] andthe evolution of its “Note on Light Scalars” over theyears, as well as the historical accounts in relatively re-cent reviews [2294, 2295]. An additional pair of scalarmesons, sitting very close to theK ¯K threshold at 980MeV, were soon identified, presently known asf0(980)anda0(980). These are narrower and their existence hasnot been controversial, although their mass and widthvalues have changed slightly over the years. All in allthey form the lightest scalar SU(3) nonet in Fig.8.2.1.
Note the largely broken flavor symmetry since the dif-ference in the nominal masses is as large as 480 MeV. Inaddition, the mass hierarchy is inverted with respect tothe naive expectations for an ordinary nonet of quark-antiquark states as in Fig.8.1.1. For example, since insuch a scheme the a0(980) would contain no strangevalence quarks or antiquarks it should be about 200MeV lighter than theK∗0 (700), with one valence strangequark or antiquark. But this is precisely the oppositeof what is found for the lightest scalars.
Fourth, light scalars, and particularly theσ and κ,are difficult to include in the linear Regge trajectoriesthat the other ordinary mesons follow [2296–2298] .
These linear trajectories are related to the confinementmechanism. This difficulty became clear only aroundthe time when the existence of the lightest scalars wasbeing settled, and although QCD had already been for-mulated, it played no direct role in this discussion.
With the advent of QCD new interesting perspec-tives arose. In particular:Fifth, one of the most attractive possibilities of anon-abelian gauge theory like QCD is the existenceof glueballs, discussed in Section8.4. The lightest oneis expected to have scalar-isoscalar quantum numbers,and to appear as an “extra state” beyond the quarkSU(3) multiplets. It is therefore important to identifyall states within some light-scalar meson SU(3) nonets.
For this, strange states are important, since they do notmix with glueballs and count how many quark nonetsexist.

Sixth,giventhequarkconstituentmasses,tetraquarkswould be naively expected to appear naturally around1.4 GeV, if they appear at all. However, based on thedominance of the magnetic contribution of gluon in-teractions, Jaffe [2299] was able to build, within the”bag”model, tetraquarks well below 1 GeV. This sug-gests the existence of two0+ nonets, one made of suchtetraquarks, below 1 GeV, that on a first approxima-tion could be identified with the nonet in Fig. 8.2.1and another one made of ordinary q¯q above 1 GeV.
This is how light scalars became the first non-ordinary-meson candidates, in the form of tetraquarks, or mesonmolecules. Still, they are not usually considered “ex-otics”, but “crypto-exotics”, since their quantum num-bers can also be built with ordinary quark-antiquarkconfigurations, with which they will necessarily mix,thus complicating this simple picture.
Seventh and final, despite QCD being non pertur-bative at low energies, its symmetries, and particularlythe spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral symmetryleading to a mass gap between NGB and other hadrons,allow for a systematic low-energy (and low-mass) ex-pansion of amplitudes involving pions, kaons and theeta. The mathematical formulation in terms of an Ef-fective Theory [1387] in the meson sector, has been pre-sented in Section6.2 and is called Chiral PerturbationTheory (ChPT) [64, 1570]. Being the next less mas-sive states after the NGB, one would naively expectthe lightest scalars to saturate the ChPT parameters atNLO discussed in Section6.2. Once again, they do not,but the vector mesons do instead. This suggests onceagain that the dynamics that govern the formation oflight scalars might be different from that of ordinarymesons like the vectors. With all those pieces of moti-vation in mind, the rest of the section is divided in twoparts. First we will describe the light-scalars present8.2 The light scalars 269Isospin State(s) Mass Width(MeV) (MeV)0 f0(500) 400-550 400-7001/2 K∗0 (700) 630-730 520-6800 f0(980) 980-1010 40-701 a0(980) 960-1030 40-1400 f0(1370) 1200-1500 200-5001/2 K∗0 (1430) 1425 ± 50 270 ± 801 a0(1450) 1474 ± 19 265 ± 130 f0(1500) 1506 ± 6 112 ± 90 f0(1710) 1704 ± 12 123 ± 18Table 8.2.1Scalar light mesons below 1.9 GeV as listed in theRPP[278].

status, paying attention to the dispersive and analyticmethods used to settle the controversy about their ex-istence, and other dispersive applications that are ofrelevance for the next part. Since the purpose of thiswork is to celebrate the 50th anniversary of QCD, weapologizefordiscussinginthesecondpartonlythemostdirect connections with it. Namely, their description interms of (unitarized) ChPT and their dependence onthe number of colors and quark masses. We will thendiscuss what can we conclude from these results.
Present statusAs it is customary, and given the present precision, weconsidertheisospinlimit.Atpresent,19well-establishedscalar mesons are identified in the RPP [278] below 1.9GeV, which we list in Table8.2.1 with their presentnames. We have already classified 9 of them in thelightest scalar nonet in Fig. 8.2.1. The other 10 are3 isoscalars,f0(1370), f0(1500), f0(1710), thea0(1450)isovectorswiththeir3differentcharges,andthe K∗0 (1430)in 4 different combinations of strangeness amd charge.
There are more scalar mesons, but they all lie nomi-nally at or above 1.95 GeV. Hence, given the amountof strange scalars and isovectors, there must be twononets below 1.75 GeV. Looking at their masses, onelies below 1 GeV and the other one around 1.4 GeV.
Note, however, that above 1 GeV there seems to be onescalar state too many. This agrees with the expectationfor the lightest QCD glueball, that will be discussed inSection 8.4.
Comparing with other mesons made of light quarksdiscussed in Section8.1, we see that, for similar masses,they tend to have larger widths. The exception are thef0(980) and a0(980), which are narrower than the restbecause their decay intoK ¯K is suppressed due to theirproximity to theK ¯K threshold. Given theO(100) MeVwidth of most of these resonances, there must be somemixing between states with the same quantum num-bers in different nonets. This mixing most likely dis-torts the mass hierarchies expected if they were nar-row. Many mixing schemes have been proposed, butthey only make sense for the flavor part of the wavefunction. We will see below one such treatment. Unfor-tunately, they are often used for the spatial or momen-tum part, which would only make sense in the narrowwidth approximation for almost stable mesons, whichis not the case of any pair of light scalars with the samequantum numbers, and should be avoided (see Section4.6.2 in [2294] and references therein).
Ingeneral,light-scalar-mesonparametershavemuchbigger uncertainties than those of other mesons. Thisis because their large widths make them often overlapone another as well as with other analytic features likethresholds. As a consequence, in many analyses theydo not show up as clean resonance peaks and their ob-served shapes can vary strongly, depending on specificfeatures of their production, becoming dips or or be-ing even completely masked. It is therefore essential todetermine light-scalar-meson parameters from process-independent quantities. In particular, resonances arerigorously defined through their associated poles in thecomplex plane, that we briefly describe next.
8.2.2 Resonance poles and dispersive determina-tionsResonance polesThese are poles appearing in the complex s-plane ofany T-matrix element describing a process where a res-onance R is produced as an intermediate state. As atechnicalremark,thesepolesappearinconjugatedpairsin the Riemann sheet that is reached when crossing con-tinuously from above the square-root cuts associated tothe center-of-mass (CM) momenta of the particles inthe physically available intermediate states. This sheetis sometimes called “adjacent”, ”proximal” and in theelastic case ”second” sheet. Out of the conjugate pair, itis the pole in the lower-half plane that most influencesthe behavior of the amplitude on the real axis. Then, itsposition sR is related to the resonance mass and widthas √sR ≡M −iΓ/2. The familiar peak shape in themodulus squared of the amplitude is clearly observedfor real-physical values ofsonly when the resonance isnarrow and well isolated from other singularities. Onlyin such cases the simple Breit-Wigner (BW) approxi-mation, or models like K-matrices or isobar sums, etc...
may be justified. However, this is not the case for mostscalars and definitely not for thef0(500) and K∗0 (700),whichhavebeenthemostcontroversialandlateststates270 8 MESONSto be accepted as well established in the RPP. Thisis the reason why in Table8.2.1 we provide the “T-matrix pole” mass and widths, avoiding ”Breit-Wigner”parameters.
Let us then briefly comment on how the poles ofthose states are determined by means of model inde-pendent dispersive and analytic techniques, althoughwe first need to define partial waves.
Partial wavesResonances and their quantum numbers are most eas-ily identified using partial waves of definite isospin andangular momentum ℓ. For rigorous determinations ofthe lightest scalar mesons, the most relevant processis meson-meson scattering, whose partial waves are de-fined as follows:fIℓ(s) = 132πK∫ 1−1dzsPℓ(zs)FI(s,t(zs)), (8.2.1)where FI(s,t) are the amplitudes, or elements of theT-matrix, of definite isospinI; s,t are the usual Mandel-stamm variables,Pℓ the Legendre polynomials andzsthescatteringangleinthe schannel.Notethat K = 1,2for Kπ and ππ, respectively, because, for hadron inter-actions, pions are identical particles in the isospin limitthat we will use.
It is convenient to recast partial waves in terms ofthe phase shiftδIℓ and elasticityηIℓas follows:fIℓ(s) = ηIℓ(s)ei2δIℓ(s) −12iσ(s) , σ (s) = 2q(s)√s , (8.2.2)where q is the CM momentum of the scattering par-ticles. In the elastic regimeηIℓ = 1 and we can write:fIℓ(s) = eiδIℓ(s) sin δIℓ(s)σ(s) . (8.2.3)For later purposes it is important to recall that we areinterested in poles in the second Riemann sheet. Let usillustrate the elastic case, where the analytic continu-ation to the second sheet through the physical cut isvery simple. Moreover, it is the most relevant for theσ/f0(500) and κ/K∗0 (700), since they appear in elas-tic ππ and πK scattering, respectively, well below thenext open threshold. For elastic partial waves, the fol-lowing relation holds: Sℓ = 1 + 2 iσ(s)fℓ. Note that,in the partial-wave context, the T-matrix is actuallycalled f. In addition, above threshold, the unitarity ofthe S-matrix impliesIm fIℓ(s) = σ(s)|fIℓ(s)|2, Im fIℓ(s)−1 = −σ(s),(8.2.4)which in turn imposes the following unitarity bounds:|fIℓ(s)|≤ 1/σ(s). (8.2.5)Knowing the imaginary part offIℓ on the cut allows usto write a very simple relation between theS-matrix inthe first (I) and second (II) sheet:S(II)ℓ = 1S(I)ℓ, f (II)(s) = f(I)1 + 2 iσ(s)f(I) , (8.2.6)where the isospin and angular-momentum indices havebeenmomentarilysuppressedforconvenience.Notethatin the second sheetσ(s∗) = −σ(s)∗.
Nevertheless, in theσ and κ case we still need toknow the value offIℓ in the first Riemann sheet, butvery deep in the complex plane. Unfortunately, the con-tinuation to the complex plane is a hard and unstablemathematical problem. Different parameterizations ormodels, seemingly equivalent when describing data ina given region, may lead to different analytic continua-tions and different poles. The rigorous way of extendingthe amplitudes to the complex plane is through disper-sion relations, if available, and analytic continuationtechniques.
Analyticity and dispersion relationsRelativisticcausalityimpliesthattheamplitude F(s,t),for fixedt, must be analytic in the first Riemann sheetof the complexs-plane except for the real axis. In theabsenceofboundstatesinmeson-mesonscattering,onlysingularity cuts are present on the real axis. First ofall, a right-hand-cut (RHC) appears from threshold to+∞. Crossing this RHC continuously leads to the adja-cent Riemann sheet, where resonance poles may exist.
In turn, crossing symmetry implies that there is a left-hand-cut (LHC) from −∞to s = −t due to cuts inthe u channels. In particular, the LHC extends up tos= 0 forforwardscattering( t= 0)andforpartial-waveamplitudes. Finally, for scattering of two particles withdifferent masses, thePℓ(cos θ) integration in the partialwave definition yields a circular cut of radius|m21 −m22|centered ats= 0 . Then, Cauchy’s integral formula re-lates the amplitude at anysin the first Riemann sheetwith integrals over the amplitude imaginary part alongthe cuts. These are called dispersion relations.
Since Cauchy’s Integral formula applies to functionsthat depend on one variable, says, the other variableshave to be fixed or integrated over. Of particular in-terest are forward dispersion relations (FDRs), whichcorrespond to the fixed-t case with t = 0 . Also of in-terest for our discussion below are hyperbolic disper-sion relations, obtained whens,t,u are fixed to lie onan hyperbola (s−a)(u−a) = b. Any of these rela-tions can also be integrated int as in Eq. (8.2.1) to8.2 The light scalars 271obtain a partial-wave dispersion relation. In principle,forward dispersion relations are applicable at anys, butfor different fixed-tand hyperbolic cases the applicabil-ity is reduced. These applicability domains affect thoseof the partial waves, depending on how they have beenobtained (see the appendix in [2295] for details).
Generically, the most complicated part of the calcu-lation are the left and circular cuts. Within the contextof light scalars, partial-wave dispersion relations are themost relevant and we can crudely group their most fre-quent uses into two categories precision dispersive ap-proaches and unitarization techniques.
Before discussing these two uses in detail, let usjust mention that dispersive approaches also constrainRegge trajectories and they hence can be used to calcu-late, not fit, the Regge parameters of resonances usingtheir poles as input. While the resulting trajectoriesfor ordinary mesons like theρ(770), K∗(892), f′2(1525),f′2(1525) come out [2297, 2300] with a rather smallimaginary part and a dominant real part, whoses de-pendence is almost a straight line, as expected, thosefor thef0(500) and κ come at odds with the ordinarybehavior [2297, 2298]. This explains why the latter donot fit well in the usual phenomenological Regge plots.
Precision dispersive approaches:We aim at mathematical rigor to establish the exis-tence of the σ and κ poles and at precision to deter-mine their parameters. Note that these are the polesclosest to the left and circular cuts. Therefore, thosecuts can be rewritten using the partial-wave expan-sion of the crossed channels. This complicates the inte-grands, and the new relations then couple different par-tial waves and channels. These relations are genericallycalled Roy-like equations [2301]. There are variationslike Roy-Steiner ([2302, 2303] for different masses andhyperbolic relations), GKPY ([2304] with minimal sub-tractions), etc. Their applicability is reduced in prac-tice to energies around 1.1 GeV for ππ [2305, 2306]and πK scattering [2307]. The inelastic, higher-energy,and higher-wave contributions are calculated from phe-nomenological fits. They have been used with two ap-proaches:– Solving the equations forthelowestpartialwaves ℓ=0,1, in the region of interest, without using any datain that region. All other contributions come fromphenomenological fits. Sometimes these are supple-mented with ChPT constraints, which reduce con-siderably the uncertainties. Thus, poles and resultsin the resonance region could be considered as pre-dictions from the equations and the other terms(and ChPT if used). The proof of the applicabilityof this approach to determine the existence of theσ/f0(500) and κ/K∗0 and their resulting parameterswere provided in [2308] and [2309], respectively.
– Data driven approach . Here Roy-like equations areused as constraints on fits to theS and P partial-wave data [2310]. Data sets that are largely incon-sistent with these constraints are discarded. Addi-tionalcontributionsfromhigherenergiesandpartialwaves are constrained with forward dispersion rela-tions and sum rules. Simple parameterizations arethen fitted to the remaining data, but constrainedto satisfy Roy-like equations in different versionsand/or number of subtractions, as well as forwarddispersion relations up to 1.42 GeV forππ [2304]and up to 1.6 GeV forπK [2311]. The latter waslater coupled to ππ →K ¯K and studied in [2295]with Roy-Steiner equations. With this approach theσ/f0(500) and κ/K∗0 (700) poles were obtained in[2310] and [2295, 2312], respectively.
Recall that dispersion relations are written in thefirstRiemannsheet.However,inbothapproachesabove,poles can be determined within a fully dispersive ap-proach, because the second sheet can be easily obtainedusing Eq. (8.2.6). In contrast, accessing the “contigu-ous” sheet in the inelastic regime requires additionalanalytic continuation methods. Detailed reports on thedispersivedeterminationsofthe σ/f0(500) andκ/K∗0 (700)poles can be found in [2294] and [2295], respectively.
For convenience we have gathered their resulting polesin Tables 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. We also provide the mod-ulus of the coupling to the dominant decay channel.
Note that the uncertainty and spread of the disper-sive results is much smaller than the RPP estimates inTable 8.2.1. This is because other non-dispersive andmodel-dependent determinations are included in theRPP estimate. However, the existence of two indepen-dentdispersiveapproacheswasdecisivetoconsiderbothresonances as well established in the RPP 2012 and2020editions,respectively,changingtheirnominalmassesin their names to be closer to their pole values.
Note that the f0(980) pole was obtained simulta-neously within the same framework [2304, 2308]. How-ever, being a narrow resonance and further away fromleft cuts, its pole is more similar to those obtained withother methods. Finally, some of these analytic continu-ation methods — using dispersively constrained input— have been applied to determine the poles of furthermesons in the inelastic regime, including the scalarsK0(1430) [2315], f0(1370) and f0(1500) [2316]. In suchcase Eqs. (8.2.3), (8.2.4) and (8.2.6) do not hold and theuse of analytic continuation methods is unavoidable tosuppress any model dependence.272 8 MESONS8.2.3 Light scalars and QCDIn the previous section, we have discussed how the rig-orous dispersive approach was instrumental in settlingthe controversy about the existence and parameters ofthe σ and κ. Once this is settled, we now concentrateon light scalars within the context of QCD, which is thesubject of this volume.
Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory (UChPT)Being so light, these resonances lie in the non pertur-bative region of QCD, and thus an effective treatmentwith ChPT seems appropriate. However, the ChPT se-ries by itself cannot generate poles and also violatesunitarity as the energy reaches the resonance region.
The most successful approach is thus a combination ofChiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) with dispersion re-lation. This is generically known as unitarized ChPT.
ChPT, which is the low-energy theory of QCD, andis formulated as an expansion in momenta or massesof the NGB, has been introduced for the meson sectorin section6.2.2. Meson-meson scattering partial wavesare then expanded asf(s) = f2(s) + f4(s) + ..., wheref2n(s) = O(p2/F2π)×O(p/Λχ)2n−2, wherepare the me-son CM momenta or masses,Λχ = 4 πF0 and F0 is theNGB decay constant at LO, common to all mesons atthat order. Up to higher ordersF0 can be approximatedby Fπ, FK.... Note that we have suppressed momentar-ily the isospin and angular momentum indicesI,ℓ. Asan example, theO(p2) or LOππ and πK elastic partialTable 8.2.2σ/f0(500) pole determinations using Roy-Steinerequations and the conservative dispersive estimate [2294] whichcovers them.

ChPT amplitudes are an expansion in powers ofpand cannot satisfy the unitarity condition in Eq. (8.2.4)exactly, but just perturbatively:Imf2(s) = 0 , Imf4(s) = σ(s)f2(s)2,... (8.2.8)When p/Λχ is very small, this is not a problem, but theviolation of unitarity grows with momenta or energy.
This violation then becomes a severe caveat to describeresonances, since in the typical cases, resonant effectssaturate the unitarity bound in Eq.8.2.5. Even worse,the ChPT series cannot generate poles ins and thus,in principle cannot generate resonances.
Therefore, if we want to describe resonances, weneed to implement unitarity, but also analyticity if wewanttostudytheirassociatedpoles.Letusnowprovidea simple, but formal, derivation of ChPT unitarizationmethods. The elastic unitarity condition in Eq.8.2.4fixes the imaginary part of the inverse partial wave.
Hence, naively, we just have to use ChPT to calcu-late the real part of the inverse amplitude, and write:Re(1/f) = Re 1 /(f2+f4+...) ≃(1/f2)(1−Ref4/f2+...),since f2 is real from Eq. (8.2.7). Then we write a uni-tarized elastic partial wave at different orders as:fULO(s) = 11/f2(s) −iσ(s), (8.2.9)fUNLO(s) = 11/f2(s) −Ref4(s)/f2(s)2 −iσ(s),...(8.2.10)and similar expressions for NNLO, etc... Note that theChPT series is recovered if re-expanding again. Theseexpressions are unitary and can be recast in explicitlyanalytic forms. For instance, using Eqs.8.2.8, the sec-ond one is fUNLO = f22 /(f2 −f4), which is known asthe NLO Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM). Similaranalytic formulas for higher orders exist [2317–2319].
Thus these methods can be analytically continued tothecomplexplaneandthesecondsheetusingEq.( 8.2.6).
This derivation is formal, because strictly speaking wecould still not use the expansion of the real part beyondthe applicability realm of ChPT into the resonance re-gion. However, there are derivations [2320–2322] frompartial-wave dispersion relations for the inverse partialwave and ChPT is only used in the subtraction con-stantsat s= 0 orintheleftandcircularcuts.Theuseofseveral subtractions makes those cuts to be dominatedby the low energies, where ChPT is applicable, thusjustifying the use of the Inverse Amplitude Method.8.2 The light scalars 273Interestingly, with the simplest possible calculation,i.e. using just the LO in Eqs. (8.2.9) and (8.2.7) in thechiral limitMπ,MK →0, we find the following poles inthe second Riemann sheets of the partial waves wherethe σ/f0(500) and κ/K∗0 (700) are seen:f00 : √sσ = (1 −i)√8πF0 ≃(463 −i463) MeV,(8.2.11)f1/20 : √sκ = (1 −i)8√π/5F0 ≃(638 −i638) MeV,where for the numerical values of F20 we have takenF2π ≃92.3 MeV for ππ and FπFK for πK scattering,with FK = 1 .19Fπ [278]. Taking into account that thisisthemostnaiveLOunitarizedcalculation,withnofreeparameters, the lightest scalar masses come remarkablyclose to their actual values and their widths about a fac-tor of 2 too wide. Note that the only dynamical infor-mation is the scale of the spontaneous chiral symmetrybreaking, given byF0. In contrast, if the same proce-dure is followed with the vectorℓ= 1 channels, the re-sulting poles for theρ(770) and K∗(892) come almosttwice too heavy and their widths more than 16 timestoo wide. This is already an indication that the LO low-energy chiral dynamics plays a predominant role in theformation of light scalar resonances, and very little forother ordinary mesons.
The description of meson-meson scattering at NLOin UChPT is very succesful for both scalar and vectorpartial waves in all isospin combinations (tensor wavesstart at NNLO). In particular, now not only the pole-width of the scalars comes right, but also the vectormeson poles and their parameters. Recall that, as ex-plained in Section6.2, the NLO ChPT calculations con-tain several Low Energy ConstantsLi(µ), which multi-ply the terms in the NLO Lagrangian allowed by sym-metry. They are scale dependent because they absorb,through renormalization, the loop divergences at pre-vious orders. In addition, they contain the informa-tion about the underlying quark and gluon dynamics,namely, QCD. Only when theseLi are taken into ac-count it is possible to describe the “ordinary” quark-antiquark vector mesons with UChPT. However, theLi combinations that appear in the scalar channels aremuch less relevant numerically and that is why scalarpoles come out fairly decent with just the LO UChPTand just information on the chiral breaking scale.
So far we have only discussed elastic unitarization.
But exactly the same naive derivation can be followedin matrix form to obtain a coupled channelT-matrixformalism [2323–2325], only slightly more complicated.
When this is done, besides the f0(500) and K∗0 (700)poles, those associated to thea0(980) and f0(980) res-onances also appear in the Inverse Amplitude Method[2325], completing the lightest scalar nonet, as well asthose of theρ(770) and K∗(892) vectors.
Many variations of ChPT unitarization techniquesexist in the literature of which, together with the IAM,thesimplestandmostpopularistheChiralUnitaryAp-proach [2326,2327] (for other variations, see the reports[2294,2328–2330]),whichusuallyraisesthecaveataboutsome arbitrariness. However, all unitarization methodsjust correspond to finer or more crude approximationsto Re(1/f) and its ChPT series or to different treat-ments of the left cut, or even including some additionalheavier states. But as long as they contain the basicinformation about the chiral scale, or are equivalent tothe ChPT LO, they all obtain a similar description oflight scalars, whereas vectors or other resonances canbe accommodated only when including enough NLOinformation.
Of course, since unitarization methods involve sometruncation of ChPT and approximations, they are notcompetitive in precision and rigor with the precise dis-persive approaches discussed before. They have, how-ever, another advantage, which is that we can studythe dependence of the resonances on QCD parameters,which we will describe next.
Leading QCD 1/Nc behaviorAt leading order in the1/Nc expansion [1163, 2331],ordinary q¯q mesons behave as M ∼ O(1) and Γ ∼O(1/Nc). Genuine tetraquark states [2332, 2333] haveat least that same Nc behavior, which is even moresuppressed for glueballs.
First of all, using meson-meson scattering and thelight-resonance pole parameters it is possible to buildobservableswhosesub-dominant Nc correctionsarehighlysuppressed [2334]. When evaluated for thef0(500) andK∗0 (700) the resulting values are at odds with the or-dinary meson or glueball behavior by several orders ofmagnitude.
Next, using the effective theory approach, the1/Ncleading order of the NLO ChPT parameters is knownfrom a model-independent analysis:Mπ,MK ∼O(1),F0 ∼√Nc and theLi behavior is eitherO(1) or O(Nc)[64, 2335]. If in the UChPT amplitudes we then callp a parameter whose behavior is O(Nkc) and changeits value top →p(Nc/3)k, we will obtain the leading1/Nc behavior of resonances following their associatedpoles as Nc is increased. Thus, already with the sub-stitution F0 → F0√Nc/3 in the LO UChPT resultsin Eqs. (8.2.11), we obtain a non-ordinary behavior forboth theσ and κ. Namely, theirM,Γ ∼O(√Nc).
That was just the naive LO estimate, but the lead-ing 1/Nc dependence within UChPT has been stud-ied to NLO in [2325, 2336] and NNLO in [2337]. It isthen possible to study the light vectors as well, andthey come remarkably compatible with the expected274 8 MESONSordinary behavior. This is shown for theρ(770) in thetop panel of Fig. 8.2.2. However, the σ and κ poles,shown in the center and bottom panels of Fig.8.2.2,respectively, display again a non-ordinary behavior, atleast near the physical value ofNc = 3 . This is a ro-bust result also found in other approaches. Of course ifNc is made very large, the dominance of meson loopsgoverned just by F0, which are suppressed by 1/Nc,fades away. Then, even the tiniest mixture with an or-dinary meson could dominate at sufficiently largeNc.
We should remark that there is some uncertainty, thatgrows withNc due to the scale dependence of theLi,illustrated for the σ in Fig. 8.2.2. Indeed, Fig. 8.2.2shows that the sigma pole could turn back [2338] tothe real axis, well above 1 GeV. This could be a smallmixture with an “ordinary” state around or above 1GeV. This is also found in NNLO UChPT [2337]. Sim-ilarly, in other phenomenological approaches theσ andκonly appear when the unitarized meson-meson inter-action is included, showing up as an additional pole dueto unitarization, in addition to ordinary states above 1GeV that are present even if meson-meson interactionsare turned off (this was first proposed in [2339], for ad-ditional references see[2294]). Back to UChPT, the or-dinary subdominant component restores the semi-localduality sum-rules [2338] that would be violated if thelight scalars just disappeared from the spectrum by be-coming too massive and wide. However, other analyses[2340, 2341], challenged in [2342], yield a σ behaviorcloser to the one of the opposite side of the scale uncer-tainty in Fig.8.2.2, reaching the third quadrant at verylarge Nc, which lacks a clear interpretation. One shouldnevertheless recall that the large-Nc regime, althoughof mathematical interest, is not the one of relevance forthe observed meson, but the leading1/Nc behavior nearNc = 3.
Quark-mass dependence and light-scalar multipletsThe study of quark-mass dependence is of interest tounderstand the dynamics of their formation, to providea guideline for lattice studies, and to check that thelight scalar states that we have grouped in an octetare degenerate when the strange and non-strange quarkmasses are equal.
We have seen in Section6.2 the relation betweenquark and meson masses. This allows us to study thequark mass dependence of the σ at NLO [2343] andNNLO [2344] andκat NLO [2345]. A slight IAM mod-ification is used to deal with subthreshold Adler zeros[2346]. Figure 8.2.3 thus shows the resultingσ and κpion mass dependence. Note that beyond 300-350 MeVthe results are at most qualitative. With increasing pionmass, the meson masses grow, although slower than400 600 800 1000 1200M ρ (MeV)-200-160-120-80-400−Γ ρ/2 (MeV)Nc=3Nc=6Nc=9Nc=12Ncone-loop SU3 ρ Pole trayectory0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200M σ (MeV)-700-600-500-400-300-200-Γσ/2 (MeV)µ=770 MeVµ=1000 MeVµ=500 MeVNcone-loop SU3 σ pole trajectoryNcNc=3666121212November 26, 2004 14:14 WSPC/146-MPLA 01616Light Scalars as Tetraquarks or Two-Meson States from Large-Nc 2889400 600 800 1000 1200M-1000-800-600-400-2000-i G2Nc =3Nc =5Nc =10Nc =20s or f0 H600Lpole movement700 800 900 1000 1100 1200M-1000-800-600-400-2000-i G2Nc =3Nc =5Nc =10k pole movement400 600 800 1000 1200M-70-60-50-40-30-20-100-i G2Nc =3Nc =5Nc =10Nc =20rH770Lpole movement700 800 900 1000 1100 1200M-20-15-10-50-i G2Nc =3Nc =5Nc =10Nc =20K\* H892Lpole movementFig. 2. Large-Nc behavior of poles in the lower half of the second Riemann sheet of the unita-rized one-loop meson{meson scattering amplitude from ChPT. For each value of Nc the pole isrepresented by a dot, in dierent meson{meson scattering channel. Note that the  and  behavioris opposite to that of well-known vector states as the  and K.
Not only can we see that vectors become bound states and scalars do not, butwe can also determine what is the precise Nc dependence. Before doing that, weshould nevertheless recall that it is not known at what scale  to apply the large-Ncto the Li. Certainly, the logarithmic part in Eq. (1) is subleading, but it has beenpointed out32 that it can be rather large for Nc = 3, which is our starting pointfor the Nc evolution. In addition, the scale dependence is suppressed by 1=Nc forLi = L2; L3; L5; L8, but not for 2L1  L2; L4; L6 and L7. The choice , or, in otherwords, the choice of \initial values", is a systematic uncertainty typical of the large-Nc approach. Customarily, the uncertainty in the  where the Nc scaling applies isestimated4 varying  between 0.5 and 1 GeV. We will check that this estimate iscorrect with the vector mesons, rmly established as qq states. In addition, and inorder to show that the choice of IAM sets in Table 1 is irrelevant for our analysis,we change now to set III. The behavior is exactly that already found in Fig. 2 andin previous works.1;2Let us then look back at vector mesons. In Fig. 3 we show, for increasing Nc, themodulus of the (I; J) = (1; 1) and (1=2; 1) amplitudes with the Breit{Wigner shapeof the  and K(892), respectively. There is always a peak at an almost constantposition, becoming narrower as Nc increases. We also show the evolution of the and K pole positions, related to their mass and width as pspole ' M   i =2. Wehave normalized both M and   to their value at Nc = 3 in order to compare withthe expected qq behavior: MNc =M3 constant and  Nc = 3  1=Nc The agreementFig. 8.2.2Trajectories of theρ(770) (top), σ/f0(500) (center)and κ/K∗0 (700) (bottom) poles in the complex plane asNc isvariedawayfrom3withinNLOChPTunitarizedwiththeIAM.

thetwo-pionthreshold,andtheirpole-widthsdecreases.
When the pion mass is 2-3 times its physical value,the 2π threshold is above the pole-mass of these reso-nances. Then, their behavior differs dramatically fromthat of the ρ(770) and K∗(892) (the latter shown inFig. 8.2.3). The width of these non-scalar mesons wouldtend to zero, and their conjugated pair of poles wouldmeet at threshold [2343, 2349]. Right after that, oneof their poles would jump to the first sheet, whereasthe other would remain at a symmetric position in the8.2 The light scalars 275second sheet, both below threshold. This is a boundstate. In contrast, theσ and κ conjugated poles meetin the second sheet below threshold. The two branchesobserved in Fig. 8.2.3 correspond to these two polesin the second sheet, where at first one moves towardsthreshold and the other away form it. The closest one tothreshold, influencing the most the physical region, isknown as a “virtual” or quasi-bound state. Eventually,itreachesthresholdandjumpstothefirstsheet,becom-ing a bound state. However, its second-sheet counter-part lies in a rather different position. The more asym-metric their positions, the more predominant is their“molecular” or “meson cloud” nature. Hence, UChPTsuggests that, at high pion masses, both thef0(500)and K∗0 (700) are closer to two-meson states than to or-dinary mesons.
Quark masses can be changed on the lattice. Actu-ally, calculations are not often done at physical masses,which are expensive numerically. Note also that ana-lytic continuation to reach poles would be required, al-though models are often used to reach poles. There arelattice calculations for theσ [2350, 2351], supportingits molecular picture at very large pion masses, whereit is a bound state. Theσ is also found at moderatelylarge pion masses [523, 2352] qualitatively consistentwith UChPT. For mπ = 236 MeV [523, 524] latticeLet us remark that the appearance of two branches is notan artifact of the IAM, but is a general feature of scatteringtheory of scalar amplitudes with poles close to threshold[43], also seen in other contexts [ 44]. It is just the wayscalar poles approach to threshold as one changes thefeatures of the interaction. Namely, there are no restrictionson where a scalar pole should be on the real axis belowthreshold on the second Riemann sheet, except that polesappear in conjugate pairs out of the real axis, or on the realaxis below threshold. In the ﬁrst case, they obviously havethe same ‘‘mass’’ but, if this pair reaches the real axis, thetwo poles no longer have to be conjugated and hence thedouble branch is a general feature. In contrast, all nonscalarwaves have centrifugal p2J factors relevant around thresh-old, that force their second sheet poles to reach the real axisprecisely at threshold [ 43] where one of them jumps intothe ﬁrst sheet whereas the other stays in the second, as ithappens here with the /C26 ð770Þ.
The IAM, of course, not only reproduces this generalfeature, but also provides an estimate of the pion masswhere this apparent splitting occurs, which is not generic,but a speciﬁc value due to the QCD dynamics underlyingthe properties of the lightest scalar meson.
Let us remark that all our ﬁts are very consistent witheach other for the /C27 , despite their differences for the /C26behavior. As explained above, this is due to the fact that inthe generation of the /C27 the chiral loops play a dominantrole. At NLO these are independent of the LECs, and atNNLO they only depend on the Oðp4Þ LECs, but not on theri. Therefore the /C27 avoids most of the largest uncertaintiesthat affect the /C26 and, as a consequence, the results for the /C27are much more robust. There are however some quantita-tive differences with the one-loop results in [ 1]: for in-stance, the point where the two conjugate poles of the /C27meet on the real axis occurs for m/C25 masses about 20 MeVlower, namely, at m/C25 ¼ 280–310 MeV for the differenttwo-loop ﬁts versus 300–330 MeV for the one-loop de-scription. This is a rather small correction to the one-loopresult and conﬁrms the robustness of our results for the /C27 ,even under higher loop corrections, at least up to m/C25 ’300–350 MeV , depending on the observable. However, forhigher pion masses the quantitative spread is much larger,although the four ﬁts yield the same qualitative predictionsfor the poles in the two branches. Closely related to thedecrease of the ‘‘splitting point’’ is the fact that the pole ofthe ‘‘upper branch’’ reaches the threshold faster than in theone-loop case as the pion mass grows. Note that, in theupper panel of Fig. 7, the threshold variation correspondsto the line labeled 2m/C25 , and that the upper branches of allﬁts touch it very soon after the two branch splitting, aroundm/C25 ’ 290–350 MeV , versus m/C25 ’ 460 MeV for the one-loop calculation in [ 1].
The relevance of these results is that, when the upperbranch pole reaches threshold, it jumps into the ﬁrstRiemann sheet, and becomes a usual bound state. (Onemight wonder if the dispersion relation for the IAM appliesnow that there is a pole on the ﬁrst Riemann sheet, but notethat the IAM derivation is obtained from dispersion rela-tions for the inverse amplitude, so that this pole on the ﬁrstRiemann sheet is a zero for the inverse amplitude andtherefore does not alter the analytic structure). Our two-loop results seem to indicate that a conventional boundstate—not a virtual one—might be found for pion masseshigher than 290–350 MeV, contrary to the 460 MeV wefound at one loop, which as we have seen was for sureoutside the region where our approach is reliable.

The interesting point for us is to note the continuous moveme nt of the pole locations of the κ ,a0(980), σ and f0(980) from their physical positions ( λ = 0) to a degenerate octet plus a singletas shown in ﬁg.2, for a common SU(3) mass m0 = 350 MeV and a step in λ of 0.1. This clearlyshows that an octet and a singlet of resonances in the SU(3) li mit evolve and give rise to thephysical poles of the lightest scalars so that these resonan ces must be considered as the lightestnonet of scalar resonances. Thus, the κ and a0(980) are pure octet states while the σ and f0(980)are a mixture of the singlet and octet I = 0 states.

W e now perform a standard SU(3) analysis of the coupling cons tants of the lightest scalarresonances to pairs of pseudoscalars within the aforementi oned SU(3) assignment. The couplingconstants are obtained by determining the residues at the po le positions of the resonances throughthe expression:Tij = lims→sR− gigjs − sR, (2.4)6Fig. 8.2.4 Trajectories of the poles that appear in coupled-channel unitarized amplitudes of different isospin as the pion,kaon and eta masses are varied from their physical values to acommon value of 350 MeV [2354]. This shows that the lightestscalars actually belong to a nonet in the SU(3) limit. The twotrajectories with I = 0 correspond to the singlet and octetstates, not directly to the poles of theσ or f0(980) resonances,which are a mixture of these two. Figure taken from [2354].
results are consistent with a pole now in the secondRiemann sheet, also consistent with UChPT. A virtualstate was found forκ in πK scattering on the lattice[516, 542], again in qualitative agreement with UChPT.
However, as the pion mass becomes lighter, theσ andκ poles are plagued again with instabilities [517, 524,525]. In [2353], Adler zeros, i.e. chiral symmetry, werefound to be very relevant in theκdetermination. A dis-persive “data driven” approach of the kind explainedabove may be relevant for a robust extraction of lightscalar poles from lattice-QCD. We refer to Section4 forfurther details.
The strange-quark mass can also be varied [2345],but not much since it is already quite high, and thus theobserved changes on scalars are very smooth. However,when changing both quark masses one can reach thedegenerate pion-kaon mass limit. Fig.8.2.4 shows thatthe trajectories of the κ pole, and a combination ofthe σ and f0(980) become degenerate with thea0(980)pole in that limit. This result has been obtained [2354]within the Unitary Chiral Approach, where the left cutis neglected and the effect of theLi are mimicked bya mass-independent cutoff. Still, this provides a strongsupport for the assignment of these states to the samelightest scalar octet.
8.2.4 SummaryDespitetheirrelevantroleinnumerousaspectsofhadronphysics and QCD, the controversy about the existenceand the parameters of the lightest scalar nonet, partic-ularly for theσ/f0(500) and κ/K∗0 (700), predated theestablishment of QCD. The settling of this controversy276 8 MESONSwas hindered by the conflicting available data sets andthe by the use of models. We have provided here a briefaccount on how it has been settled recently by usingrigorous dispersive techniques to constrain data analy-ses and to determine the poles associated to the light-scalar resonances. Many phenomenological approacheswere able to describe to different degrees of accuracythese states. Here, we have focused on those most di-rectly linked to QCD through the unitarization of Chi-ral Perturbation Theory, the 1/Nc behavior and thedependence on the quark masses. The general picturethat arises is that there is one light scalar nonet below 1GeV. Their non-ordinaryNc behavior, quark mass de-pendence, Regge trajectories, and the fact that they donot saturate the ChPT constants strongly support thatthese mesons are not of the ordinary quark-antiquarktype. Rather their predominant component would beof the meson-meson type (molecule, meson cloud, etc).
Still they are most likely mixed with some companionbare or preexistent quark-antiquark state above 1 GeV.
Indeed, a second scalar multiplet can be identified be-tween 1.2 and 1.8 GeV. There is still ample room forrefining this picture and a high expectation on furtherexperiments and developments from lattice-QCD.
8.3 Exotic mesonsBoris Grube8.3.1 IntroductionAlready when Gell-Mann [17] and Zweig [18] formu-lated the constituent quark model they presumed thatadditionalstatesbeyondthebaryonic qqq andthemesonicq¯q combinations exist.77 For a long time, the searchfor such states was unsuccessful and hence all hadronicstates going beyond the constituent quark model werelabelled exotic. However, rather recently experimentshave found compelling evidence that exotic states in-deed exist. Here, we will focus on exotic mesons, whichcanbedividedintothreecategories:(i) spin-exotic states,which have JPC quantum number combinations thatare not possible for ordinaryq¯qstates (cf. Tab.8.1.1),7877 In Ref. [17], Gell-Mann writes: “Baryons can now be con-structed from quarks by using the combinations(qqq), (qqqq¯q),etc., while mesons are made out of(q¯q), (qq¯q¯q), etc.” Similarly,Zweig writes in a footnote in Ref. [18]: “In general, we wouldexpect that baryons are built not only from the product of threeaces, AAA, but also from ¯AAAAA, ¯A¯AAAAAA, etc., where¯Adenotes an anti-ace. Similarly, mesons could be formed from¯AA, ¯A¯AAAetc.”78 More correctly, these states have forbiddenJPG quantumnumbers. However, here we use the common convention thatthe C-parity of a charged meson in an isospin triplet is givenby theC-parity of its neutral partner state.
(ii)flavor-exotic states,whichhaveflavorquantumnum-bers, such as isospin and/or strangeness, that are notpossiblefor q¯qstates,and(iii) crypto-exotic states,whichhave quantum numbers of ordinaryq¯q states and aretherefore able to mix with them.
Possible exotic mesonic configurations beyond q¯qare four-quark combinations such as tightly boundqq¯q¯qtetraquark states, where the constituents are bound di-rectlybythestrongforce,ormorelooselybound (q¯q)(q¯q)molecular states,whichconsistofapairofmesonsboundby nuclear forces. Also, the gluon fields are expected tomanifest themselves in the meson spectrum either inthe form of hybrid states , where, in addition to aq¯qpair, excited gluonic field configurations contribute tothe quantum numbers of the meson, or in the form ofglueballs, which are color-singlet bound states of glu-ons (see Sec.8.4). However, in general, physical mesonsare not pure realizations of single configurations butare instead mixtures of all possible configurations thatare allowed for the given quantum numbers. Disentan-gling these different contributions is a highly difficultexperimental and theoretical problem.
Crypto-exotic states will manifest themselves as su-pernumerarystatescomparedtothespectrumexpectedfrom the quark model. This makes them rather diffi-cult to establish. And even if experimental data unam-biguously show an overpopulation of states in a cer-tain mass range, the determination of the internal con-figuration of these states is an even harder problem.
The prime example for such a situation is the sector ofisoscalar scalar mesons discussed in Secs.8.2 and 8.4.
Therefore, the cleanest way to unambiguously estab-lish the existence of exotic mesons is to search for spin-and/or flavor-exotic states. Presently, the clearest evi-dence for the existence of such states comes from theheavy-quark sector (see Secs.8.5 and 8.6), where ex-periments have found several flavor-exotic states witha minimum quark content of four, for example, thecharged charmonium and bottomonium states,Z±c andZ±b [1388,2355],orthedoubly-charmedstate, T+cc [1071].
Although mesons from the light-quark sector, i.e.
mesons composed of up, down, or strange quarks, areusually easier to produce in experiments, the pictureis less clear in this sector. This is mainly because lightmesons have relatively large decay widths compared totheir masses. As a consequence, these mesons usuallydo not appear as isolated and narrow peaks in the in-variant mass spectra of their decay products. Instead,theyoftenoverlapandinterferewithneighboringstates,which makes their extraction from experimental datachallenging. In addition, in most analyses models arerequired in order to extract resonances from the dataandtheresultsthereforedependontheemployedmodel8.3 Exotic mesons 277assumptions and approximations. In the following, wewill confine the discussion to spin-exotic light mesons.
More details on exotic light mesons can be found in thereviews in Refs. [385, 2356–2362].
8.3.2 PredictionsModel predictionsVarious models have been employed to study the light-meson spectrum. Some of these model approaches arediscussed in more detail in Sec.5. Further discussionscan be found, e.g., in Refs. [385, 2362]. Most of themodels that include exotic mesons predict the lightestspin-exotic state to be a hybrid meson withJPC = 1−+quantum numbers.
The first detailed studies of hybrid light mesonswere based on the bag model [750–752, 2363, 2364].
In this model, quarks and gluons are described by cav-ity modes in a confining vacuum bubble (see Sec.5.1.3).
Detailedpredictionsforthedecaysofhybridlightmesonswere obtained using, for example, the fluxtube model[2365–2371].Thismodelextendstheconventionalquarkmodel by explicitly modeling the gluonic fields in formof an oscillating flux tube described by single-phononexcitations. Decays of hybrid mesons were also studiedin constituent-glue models [2372–2375], where one as-sumes that a massless gluon withJP = 1 − interactswith quarks via potentials that depend linearly on thedistance of the constituents. Recently, also the Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeterapproach(see,e.g.,Refs.[ 904,2376, 2377] and also Sec.5.3), basis light-front quanti-zation (see, e.g., Ref. [958] and also Sec.5.4), as wellas the AdS/QCD correspondence (see, e.g., Ref. [1010]and also Sec. 5.5) were applied to study hybrid lightmesons.
The models predict the mass of the lightest 1−+state to be in the range from about 1.3 to 2.2GeVand most model calculations find thatf1(1285)π andb1(1235)π are the dominant decay modes for the light-est isovector1−+ state. However, for theηπ, η′π, andρ(770)πdecay modes, discussed in Sec.8.3.4 below, themodel predictions diverge.
Lattice QCD calculationsIn recent years, lattice QCD calculations of the hadronexcitation spectrum have made tremendous progress(see Sec. 4, in particular Sec.4.5). Currently, calcula-tionsthatstudytheexcitationspectrumoflightmesonsstill have to be performed in an unphysical world, wherethe up and down quarks are much heavier in the sim-ulation than in nature.79 The main reason for this is79 This is often expressed in terms of an unphysically largepion mass.
that decays into multi-body hadronic final states, whichfor most excited states are the dominant decay modes,cannot yet be calculated on the lattice. By setting thequark masses to sufficiently high values and neglect-ing multi-hadron operators, the excited states becomequasi stable and can be extracted from the simulation.
Consequently, such calculations cannot predict widthsand decay modes and also cannot take into accountcoupled-channel effects. Despite these limitations, lat-tice calculations have already provided important in-sights by making predictions for light-meson spectraand for two-body scattering processes [477, 498].
For example, the seminal calculation performed bytheHadronSpectrumcollaboration[ 484]showedforthefirst time a nearly complete spectrum of isoscalar andisovector mesons covering a wide range ofJPC quan-tum numbers up toJ = 4 (see Fig.4.5.2 on page89).
The lattice spectrum is qualitatively similar to the oneobtained from quark-model calculations. However, thelattice calculation in addition revealed a whole super-multiplet of extra states [493] that lie about 1.3GeVabove the lightest JPC = 1 −− state and that havequantum numbers of0−+, 1−−, 2−+, and 1−+, wherethe latter one is spin-exotic. Studying the overlap ofthese states with various operators used in the calcula-tion allowed to probe their internal structure. All statesin the supermultiplet havelarge overlaps with operatorsthatcorrespondtoachromomagneticgluonicexcitationcoupled to a color-octetq¯q pair in anS-wave and weretherefore identified as hybrid states. Intriguingly, thespin-exotic 1−+ state was predicted to be the lightesthybrid state confirming many model calculations (seeSec. 8.3.2).
Recently, the Hadron Spectrum collaboration pub-lished results of the first lattice QCD calculation of thehadronic decays of the lightest 1−+ resonance usinga two-body approximation for the decay [547]. Theyperformed this calculation at the SU(3)flavor symmetricpoint, where up, down, and strange-quark masses arechosen to approximately match the physical strange-quark mass, corresponding to a large unphysical pionmass of about 700MeV. Using a coupled-channel ap-proach, the Hadron Spectrum collaboration studied thescatteringamplitudesofeightmeson-mesonsystemsandextrapolated the extracted1−+ resonance pole and itscouplings to the physical light-quark masses. Doing soand assuming a1−+ resonance mass of 1564MeV (valuetaken from Ref [2276]), they found a broad π1 res-onance with a total width ranging between 139 and590MeV. The dominant decay mode of this resonance isb1(1235)π(partial width ranging from 139 to 529MeV),in qualitative agreement with most model calculations(see Sec. 8.3.2). Compared to the b1(1235)π channel,278 8 MESONSthepartialwidthsforthedecaysinto f1(1285)π,ρ(770)π,η′π, and ηπ are much smaller. Although these resultsstill have large uncertainties, they provide importantguidance for experiments.
The next great leap for lattice QCD is the calcula-tion of three-body systems, which is already looming onthe horizon (see Sec.4.5.8 and Ref. [558]). First proof-of-principle calculations of three-body systems that donotcontainanyresonances(see,e.g.,Fig. 4.5.9onpage 94)demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and arepaving the way towards calculations of more interest-ing systems that contain two- and/or three-body reso-nances.
8.3.3 Experimental methodsExcited light mesons can be studied in many reactions.
They are copiously produced in high-energy scatter-ing reactions of meson beams on nucleon or nucleartargets, such as diffractive dissociation or charge ex-change, as well as in central-production reactions inhadron-hadron scattering. Also, antiproton-nucleon an-nihilationsareasourceoflightmesons.Complementaryto these purely strong-interaction processes are photo-production reactions, which are induced by photon orleptonbeams,and e+e− scatteringreactionssuchasan-nihilation, initial-state radiation, or two-photon fusion.
Finally, also multi-body decays of heavy particles, suchas τ, J/ψ, or D, are good laboratories to study lightmesons. Conservation laws, couplings, and the avail-able energy impose constraints that determine whichexcited states are allowed to be produced from the var-ious initial states in these reactions. The study of thelight-meson spectrum is a world-wide effort with exper-iments performed at all major particle-accelerator labscovering all the above reactions.
Excited light mesons decay via the strong interac-tion and are hence extremely short-lived. This is whythese states are usually referred to asresonances, whichare characterized by their nominal massm0, their to-tal widthΓ0, and their quantum numbers. In the sim-plest case of an isolated resonance, its experimentalsignature is a peak at m0 in the distribution of theinvariant mass m of the system of daughter particlesthat the resonance decays into. This peak is accompa-nied by a phase motion , i.e. an increase of the phaseof the quantum mechanical amplitude of the studiedprocess by180◦ with increasingm, reaching90◦ at m0(see Fig.8.3.1). If the resonance is in addition narrowand m0 is far away from kinematical thresholds, theresonance amplitude is well approximated by a Breit-Wigner amplitude. However, in general resonances aredescribed by amplitudes that are analytical functions00.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 ]2c [GeV/Xm00.51Intensity00.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 ]2c [GeV/Xm050100150Phase [deg] Fig. 8.3.1 Example of a relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitudewith constant width for a fictitious resonance with a mass ofm0 = 1200 MeV and a total width ofΓ0 = 200 MeV.

of m2 and the resonance parameters are defined by theposition of pole singularities of this amplitude in thecomplex m2 plane (see, e.g., Ref. [2378] for more de-tails).
Depending on its mass and quantum numbers, a res-onance may have several decay modes, which for highlyexcited states often lead to multi-body hadronic finalstates consisting mostly ofπ, K, η, and/orη′. Due totheir short-lived nature, any information about reso-nances has to be inferred from the kinematic distribu-tion of their decay products. To this end,partial-waveanalysis (PWA) techniques are often employed, whichtake into account possible interferences of all the inter-mediate resonances produced in the reaction and ex-ploit the full kinematic information contained in thedata. For ann-body final state with given massm, aset τ of 3n−4 kinematic variables is needed to com-pletely define the decay kinematics. In a simplified pic-ture, a PWA model describes the measuredintensitydistribution I(m,τ), i.e. the density distribution of theevents in the(3n−4)-dimensional phase space of thefinal-state particles, in terms ofpartial-wave amplitudesTi(m),whichdescribethestrengthandphasewithwhich8.3 Exotic mesons 279an intermediate state with given quantum numbersi={JPC M}and mass m is produced, and decay ampli-tudes Ψi(m,τ), which describe the decay of this inter-mediate state into the observed final state. Here,M isthe projection of the spinJ along the chosen quanti-zation axis. High-energy scattering reactions, for whichexamples will be discussed below, are known to be dom-inated by natural-parity exchange.80 When analyzingdata from these reactions, it is hence advantageous toperform the PWA in thereflectivity basis [2379], wherethe spin state of a resonance is characterized byMϵwith M ≥0 and ϵ = ±1 such that the multiplicity of2J+1 of the spin state remains unchanged. Here,ϵcor-responds to the naturality of the exchange particle inthe scattering reaction. By performing the PWA in thisbasis, it is therefore possible to separate the contribu-tions from natural- and unnatural-parity exchange tothe scattering reaction.
Since production and decay of a resonance are in-dependent of each other, the total amplitude for an in-termediate state i is given by Ti(m) Ψi(m,τ). In thesimplest case, the amplitudes of the various allowed in-termediate statesiare assumed to be fully coherent sothatI(m,τ) =⏐⏐⏐∑iTi(m) Ψi(m,τ)⏐⏐⏐2, (8.3.1)where the sum runs over all allowed states. It is impor-tant to note that in the above equation, the intensity isgiven by the sum of the contributing amplitudes, i.e. allintermediate states may interfere with each other. Thedecay amplitudes can be calculated using first princi-ples and models. The analyses that will be discussedin Sec.8.3.4 below use a two-stage procedure, where inthe first stage the known decay amplitudesΨi are usedto determine the partial-wave amplitudesTi in narrowmbins by fitting the PWA model in Eqn. (8.3.1) to themeasured τ distributions. At this stage, no assumptionsare made about the resonance content in the studiedn-body system. In a second stage, a resonance model isfit to the m dependence of selected partial-wave am-plitudes in order to extract the resonances and theirparameters. For high-energy scattering data, the res-onance model also has to take into account contribu-tions fromnon-resonant processes, i.e. processes wherethe measured n-body final state is produced withoutgoing through an intermediaten-body resonance. Un-fortunately,inmostcasesnodetailedtheoreticalmodelsexist for these non-resonant contributions and one has80 The naturality is defined asϵ= P(−1)J, i.e.ϵ= +1 corre-sponds to the natural-parity series withJP = 0 +,1−,2+,...

to revert to empirical models. More details on the PWAprocedure and the involved model assumptions can befound, e.g., in Ref. [2380].
8.3.4 Experimental evidenceMore than three decades ago the GAMS experimentclaimed the first observation of a spin-exotic resonancewith JPC = 1 −+ [2381]. Since then, many other ex-periments reported such signals. Currently, the ParticleData Group (PDG) lists three spin-exotic light-mesonstates: the π1(1400), the π1(1600), and the π1(2015)[476]. However, despite the seemingly large body of evi-dence,whichincludesdatafrompiondiffraction,antiproton-nucleonannihilation,photoproduction,andcharmoniumdecays covering several decay channels, the experimen-tal situation is still puzzling and the interpretation ofmany of the observed signals is controversial.
The π1(1400) was observed nearly exclusively in theηπ decay channel produced in pion diffraction and anti-proton-nucleonannihilation[ 2280,2381–2387].OnlytheOBELIX and Crystal Barrel experiments claimed to seethe π1(1400) also in theρ(770)π decay channel in theirantiproton-nucleon annihilation data [2388, 2389]. Sur-prisingly, the signal in theρ(770)π channel arises fromantiproton-nucleoninitialstateswithdifferentquantumnumbers than the signal in theηπ channel.81 Since pro-duction and decay of a resonance are independent, theρ(770)π resonance claimed by OBELIX and CrystalBarrel cannot be the sameπ1(1400) state that is ob-served in ηπ—a puzzling result. Theπ1(1400) massesquoted by the various experiments are in fair agree-ment; the width values, however, scatter over a largerrange. The PDG estimates for theπ1(1400) mass andwidth are m0 = (1354 ±25) MeV and Γ0 = (330 ±35) MeV [476].
Compared to the π1(1400), the π1(1600) was seenin a much wider range of decay channels produced inpion diffraction, antiproton-nucleon annihilation, andχc1 decays. Signals were reported in theρ(770)π [2271,2390–2393], η′π [2394–2398], f1(1285)π [2397, 2399],andb1(1235)π[2274,2386,2395–2397,2400]decaychan-nels. As for theπ1(1400), the measuredπ1(1600) massvalues are in better agreement with each other thanthe measured width values. The PDG estimates for theπ1(1600) mass and width arem0 = (1661+15−11) MeV andΓ0 = (240 ±50) MeV [476].
The π1(2015) was so far only observed by the BNLE852 experiment in the decay modesf1(1285)π [2399]81 In theρ(770)πchannel, theπ1(1400) is seen predominantlyin P-wave antiproton-nucleon initial states, whereas in theηπchannel it is seen mainly in the3S1 initial state.280 8 MESONSand b1(1235) π [2274]. It hence still needs to be con-firmed by other experiments and is listed as a “furtherstate” by the PDG.
Although on first sight there seems to be strong ex-perimental evidence for theπ1(1400) and theπ1(1600),some analyses have issues and some experimental re-sultsaredisputed.Fromaphenomenologicalstandpoint,the properties of theπ1(1400) are problematic. Com-pared to most of the predictions (see Sec.8.3.2), it istoo light. Also, theπ1(1600) is too close in mass to theπ1(1400) in order to be an excitation of the latter. Ad-ditionally, the fact that theπ1(1400) seems to decayonly toηπ is hard to explain.82The analyses of some channels also face technicalissues. For example, in order to extract theπ1(1400)in the ηπ channel and the π1(1600) in the η′π chan-nel, the phase motions of theP-wave amplitudes needto be measured. Often, this can be done only relativeto the D-wave amplitudes. However, in the mass re-gion of interest theD-waves contain contributions fromthe a2(1700), which is the first radial excitation of thea2(1320) ground state. Unfortunately, thea2(1700) is arather broad state and its resonance parameters are notwell known. For the widely used simple Breit-Wignerbased resonance models, this may lead to systematicuncertainties that are hard to control.
The analysis of the data of the BNL E852 exper-iment yielded inconsistent results on the productionproperties of the π1(1600). Whereas in theη′π [2394]and f1(1285)π [2399] channels theπ1(1600) is observedto be produced only via natural-parity exchange, i.e.
with Mϵ = 1+, it appeared in theρ(770)π [2390, 2391]and b1(1235)π [2274] channels also in unnatural-parityexchange, i.e. in waves withMϵ = 0 − and 1−, withsimilar strength as in theMϵ = 1 + wave. This is hardto explain as production and decay of a resonance areindependent processes.
One of the deepest puzzles, however, concerns theseemingly contradictory conclusions on the existence ofthe π1(1600) in the ρ(770)π decay channel that weredrawn from similar analyses. The BNL E852 experi-mentwasthefirsttoclaimtheobservationof π1(1600) →ρ(770)π based on a sample of about 250000 π−p →π−π−π+peventsandusingaPWAmodelwith21waves[2390, 2391]. The measured intensity distribution of thespin-exotic wave withJPC = 1−+ quantum numbers isshown in Fig.8.3.2. It exhibits a pronounced peak atabout 1.6GeV that is accompanied by significant phase82 If one would take the π1(1400) → ρ(770)π claims ofOBELIX and Crystal Barrel [2388, 2389] at face value, theneven two mass-degenerateπ1(1400) states would exist, one de-caying toηπ the other toρ(770)π—an even more puzzling sce-nario.

[2390, 2391] claimed the ob-servation of theπ1(1600). However, they also observeda strong dependence of the shape and strength of theπ1(1600) signal on the PWA model.
Surprisingly, an analysis of a more than 20 timeslarger data sample (2.6 ×106 π−p→π−π−π+p eventsplus 3.0 ×106 π−p→π−π0π0p events) from the sameexperiment performed by Dzierbaet al. came to a com-pletely different conclusion [2401]. They performed thepartial-wave analysis independently in 12 bins of thereduced four-momentum squaredt′ that is transferredfrom the beam to the target recoil particle84 in therange from0.08 to0.53 GeV2 using a larger PWA modelof 36 waves.

ConclusionsIdentifying a glueball is a difficult task. The main argu-ment in favor of a glueball interpretation is an anoma-lously large production rate in J/ψ decays. It turnsout that scalar mesons are organized like pseudoscalarmesons, into mainly singlet and mainly octet mesons. Alarge production rate of a mainly-octet scalar isoscalarmeson in radiativeJ/ψ decays directly points to a sig-nificant glueball content in its wave function. A sec-ond argument relies an meson decays into pseudoscalarmesons. In presence of a glueball, a pair of mesons as-signed to the same multiplet should have a decay pat-tern that is incompatible with aq¯q interpretation forany mixing angle. Supernumery is a weak argument.
It requires a full understanding of the regular excita-tion spectrum. Further studies are required to learn ifcentral production is gluon-rich. The large productionrates of f0(1500), f0(1710) and f0(2100) in ¯pp anni-hilation at collision energies above 3GeV encouragesglueball searches at the FAIR facility with the PANDAdetector (see Section14.5).

[2442] as-suming that f0(1370) is a singlet state and f0(1500)an octet state. Hence we assumed that the ten mesonscan be divided into two series of states, mainly-singletstates with lower masses and mainly-octet states withhigher masses.
In a (M2,n) plot, the masses of singlet and octetstates follow two linear trajectories (see Fig.8.4.4). Re-markably, the slope (1.1GeV−2) is close to the slopeof standard Regge trajectories. The separation betweenthe two trajectories is given by the mass square differ-ence betweenη′ andη-meson as suggested by instanton-induced interactions [2448]. The figure includes a mesonreported by the BESIII collaboration studyingJ/ψ →γη′η′ [2447]. As η′η′ resonance, f0(2480) is very likelya SU(3) singlet state. Indeed, its mass is compatiblewith the “mainly-singlet” trajectory. The figure givesthe pole positions of the eleven resonances as small in-serts.
The total yields of scalar mesons in radiativeJ/ψdecays - including decay modes not reported by theBESIIIcollaboration-wasdeterminedfromthecoupled-channel analysis [2442] that included also other data.
The yield of mainly-octet and mainly-singlet mesons asa function of their mass is shown in Fig.8.4.5. Mainly-octetmesonsshouldnotbeproduced(oratmostweakly)in radiative J/ψ decays. However, they are producedabundantly, in a limited mass range centered at about1865MeV. Mainly-singlet mesons are produced over thefull mass range but show a peak structure at the samemass. This enhancement must be due to the scalar glue-ball mixing into the wave functions of scalar mainly-octet and mainly-singlet mesons. A Breit-Wigner fit tothese distributions gives mass and widthMG = (1865 ±25+10−30) MeV ΓG = (370 ±50+30−20) MeV ,(8.4.8)and the (observed) yield is determined toYJ/ψ→γG = (5.8 ±1.0) 10−3 . (8.4.9)eigenstate, this amplitude can produce isovector mesons. Thisprocess is highly suppressed and experimentally absent. ii) thef0(1370) − f0(1500) interference region is not well described,neither in the mass distribution nor in theS− D phase differ-ence. iii) The fit is neither constrained by theππ S-wave fromthe CERN-Munich data nor by the data onKe4 decays. A fitwith the seven resonances used in Ref. [2443] without an isospinbreaking amplitude leads to aππ S-wave that is extremely in-compatible with the knownππS -wave (A.V. Sarantsev, privatecommunication, October 2021.)Fig. 8.4.3 The squared S-wave tranisition amplitudes forJ/ψ → π0π0 (a) andJ/ψ → K0sK0s (b).

Blacksquares: sin2 ϕsn, solid curve: Breit-Wigner resonance with area1 [2439].
8.4.5 Meson-glueball mixingEarlier attempts to identify the glueball have in com-mon that the full glueball is distributed among thethreestates f0(1370),f0(1500) andf0(1710).InspectingFig. 8.4.3, this seems not to be obvious: Above 1GeV,four peaks with three valleys are seen, and there is noreason why one particular region should be more gluishthan the other ones. The yield of scalar mesons seesthe glueball contribution distributed over several reso-nances.
We did not impose that the full glueball should beseen in these three states nor that we must see the fullglueball at all. We fitted the decay modes of pairs ofscalar mesons, one mainly-singlet one mainly-octet, andallowed for a glueball component [2439].
fnH0 (xxx) = ( n¯ncos ϕsn −s¯ssin ϕsn) cos φGnH + Gsin φGnHfnL0 (xxx) = ( n¯nsin ϕsn + s¯scos ϕsn) cos φGnL + Gsin φGnL(8.4.10)ϕsn is the scalar mixing angle, φGnH and φGnL are themeson-glueball mixing angles of the high-mass state Hand of the low-mass state L in the nth nonet. The frac-tional glueball content of a meson is given bysin2 φGnHor sin2 φGnL.
With this mixing scheme and the SU(3) couplingconstant(seeFig. 8.4.2),wehavefittedthemesondecaymodes and have thus determined the glueball content ofthe eight high-mass scalar mesons. Figure8.4.6 showsthe glueball fraction in the scalar mesons.
The glueball fractions derived from the decay anal-ysis of pairs of scalar mesons add up to a sum thatis compatible with 1. The distribution of the glueballfraction in Fig.8.4.6 is identical to the distribution ofyields in Fig.8.4.5. This is a remarkable confirmationthat the scalar glueball of lowest mass has been iden-tified and has mass and width as given in Eqn. (8.4.8)and a yield as given in Eqn. (8.4.9).
8.4.6 Comparison with LHCb dataMoststrikingisthemountainlandscapeabove1500MeVin the data on radiativeJ/ψ decays. In these decaysa c¯c pair converts into gluons which hadronize (seeFig. 8.4.7, left). The huge peak in theK ¯K mass spec-trum at 1750MeV and the smaller one at 2100MeVdecay are produced with two gluons in the initial state.
This is to be contrasted with data onB0s and ¯B0s decaysintoJ/ψ+π+π− [2449]and K ¯K[2450].Inthisreaction,a primary s¯s pair – recoiling against theJ/ψ – con-verts into the final state mesons (see Fig.8.4.7, right).
We have included the spherical harmonic moments inthe coupled channel analysis that describes the radia-tive J/ψ decays [2451]. High-mass scalar mesons areonly weakly produced inB0s decays withs¯s in the ini-tial state. The strong peak in theK ¯K invariant massat 1750MeV in Fig. 8.4.3 is nearly absent in B0s →J/ψK ¯K!Figure 8.4.8 shows the ratio of the decay frequenciesof J/ψ →γf0 and B0s →J/ψf0 with f0 decaying intoππ or K ¯K. Thef0(980) is likely a mainly-octet state,little produced in radiative J/ψ decays but stronglywith s¯s in the initial state. On the contrary,f0(1770)is seen as strong peak in radiativeJ/ψ but very weaklyonly inB0s decays. The uncertainties are large, but theratio of the decay frequencies is fully compatible withthe shape of the glueball derived above.
This is highly remarkable: the two gluons in theinitial state must be responsible for the production ofresonances that decay strongly intoK ¯K but are nearlyabsent whens¯spairs are in the initial state. Also, thereis a rich structure in theππ mass spectrum producedin radiative J/ψ decays but little activity only whenthe initial state is ans¯s pair: The rich structure stemsfrom gluon-gluon dynamics. Similar conclusions can bedrawn [2444] from a comparison of the invariant massdistributions from radiativeJ/ψ decays with the pionand kaon form factors [2452]. Their square is propor-tional to the cross sections. Thef0(980) resonance dom-inates both formfactors but is nearly absent in radiativeJ/ψ decays: The f0(980) has large n¯n and s¯s compo-nentsmixedtoadominantSU(3)octetcomponent.Thelarge intensity above 1500MeV in radiativeJ/ψ decaysFig. 8.4.7In radiativeJ/ψdecays two gluons, in¯B0s → J/ψ+s¯s, as¯spair may convert into a scalar meson.290 8 MESONSFig. 8.4.8The ratio Rgg/s¯s of the frequencies forJ/ψ → γf0and B0s → J/ψf0 with f0 decaying intoππ or K ¯K.

8.4.7 A trace of the tensor glueballThe tensor glueball is predicted with an even higheryield [2437]:ΓJ/ψ→γ/G2++ /Γtot = (11 ±2)10−3 . (8.4.11)The yield off2(1270) in radiativeJ/ψ decays is(1.64±0.12)10−3, about six times weaker than the predictedrate for the tensor glueball! Bose symmetry implies thatthe π0π0 or KsKs pairs are limited to even angular mo-menta, practically, onlySand D-waves contribute. Thescalar intensity originates from the electric dipole tran-sition E0. Three electromagnetic amplitudesE1,M2,and E3 excite tensor mesons. Figure8.4.9 shows thesethree amplitudes and the relative phases.
Two fits were performed [2453]. One fit describesthe mass distribution only. Apart from the well knownf2(1270) and f′2(1525) the fit needs one high-mass res-onance withM = (2210 ±60) MeV; Γ = (360 ±120) MeV , (8.4.12)wheretheerrorincludessystematicstudieswithorwith-out additional low-yield resonances. The enhancementwas called X2(2210). In this fit, the phases are notwell described. Figure 8.4.9 shows a fit in which the2200MeV region is described by three tensor resonanceswith masses and widths of about(M,Γ ) = (2010 ,200),(2300,150), and(2340,320) MeV. These resonances hadbeen observed by Etkin et al. [2284] in the reactionπ−p → φφn. The unusual production characteristicswere interpreted in Ref. [2284] as evidence thatthesestates are produced by 1 −3 glueballs.

8.4.8 How to find the pseudoscalar glueballTheBESIIIcollaborationhasstudiedthereaction J/ψ →π+π−η′ [2454]. The top panel of Fig.8.4.10 shows theπ+π−η′ invariant mass distributions with a series ofpeaks.Assumingthattheseareallpseudoscalarmesons,twotrajectoriescanbedrawn(bottompanelofFig. 8.4.10).
Thefiguresuggeststhatthehigher-massstructurescouldhouse two mesons, possibly singlet and octet states inSU(3). If this is true, a cut in theπ+π− invariant mass8.4 Glueballs, a fulfilled promise of QCD? 291at about 1480MeV would partly separate the two iso-bars, X(2600)→f0(1370)η′ and X(2600) →f0(1500)η′.
We may expect a slight mass shift in the twoπ+π−η′invariant mass distributions. The two mesonsf0(1370)and η′ are both mainly singlet. Thef0(1370)η′ isobar assingletmesoninthe X(2600) complexshouldbeslightlyhigher in mass than thef0(1500)η′ mainly octet meson.
The total yields of the high-mass structures – in-cluding unseen decay modes – are not known. Nev-ertheless, their appearance above a comparatively lowbackground is surprising. Personally, I suppose that thepseudoscalar glueball is rather wide, and that the struc-tures are seen so clearly because of a small glueballcontent. More studies of theses data and of differentchannels are required to substantiate this conjecture.
8.4.9 OutlookThe data of the BESIII collaboration presented aboveare based on1.3·109 events taken at theJ/ψ. Presentlyavailable are 1010 events. Based on this large statis-tics, rare radiative decays likeJ/ψ →γηη′ [2409, 2410]and J/ψ →γη′η′ [2447] have been analysed. Data onthe different charge mode ofJ/ψ →γ4π would be ex-tremely important. In an ideal world, these data wouldbe publicly available after publication and would be in-cluded in different coupled-channel partial-wave analy-ses.

TheBaBarcollaborationstudiedradiative Υ(1S) decaysintoπ+π− and K+K− [2456]. The results are shown inFig. 8.4.12.

(With the larger statisticsin J/ψ decays, a fourth enhancement is seen at about2350MeV.) In Fig.8.4.11, a peak is found at 1447MeVand assigned to f0(1500). At 1500MeV, there is thedip. The wrong mass is due to the neglect of inter-ference: The phase between f0(1500) and the “back-ground” (due to the wider f0(1370)) is 180◦ [2442].
This phase difference and the significantf0(1500) →ηη′ branching ratio identifyf0(1500) as mainly SU(3)Foctet state. The different masses for the high-mass statein the π+π− and K+K− invariant mass distributionspoint again to the neglect of interference between theprominent octet states and the singlet “background”.

The comparison with the yield observed in Ref. [2442]allows us to calculated the branching ratio expected forψ(2S) and Υ(1S) decays when the full scalar glueballis covered, i.e. forΥ(1S) →γG0(1865). The values aregiven in Table8.4.2.
Clearly, a significant increase in statistics is requiredwhen these reactions should make in independent im-pact. The advantage ofψ(2S) and Υ(1S) radiative de-cays is of course that phase space limitations play norole any more.

8.5 Heavy quark-antiquark sector: exper-imentMarco Pappagallo8.5.1 IntroductionThe term “quarkonium” is a collective name to de-note heavy quark-antiquark bound statesQ¯Q′ (Q,Q′ =c,b) where the masses of heavy (anti-)quarks are muchlargerthan ΛQCD,thescaleofnon-perturbativephysics.
Therefore the velocities of the heavy (anti-)quark inquarkonium systems are small and a nonrelativistic po-tential between the heavy quark-antiquark can be em-ployedtopredictthepropertiesofthequarkoniumstates.
Thespectraofthecharmoniumandbottomoniumstates,with quark contentc¯cand b¯brespectively, have been ex-tensively studied in the past years. All excited quarko-niumstatesbelowtheopen-flavor D¯D(∗) orB¯B(∗) thresh-oldswerepredictedtobenarrow.TheobservationoftheJ/ψ meson in 1974 and the success, to predict the elec-tromagneticandhadronictransitionsamongthenarrowquarkonium states, established the potential models asa tool to unravel the complicated QCD dynamics.
Starting from 2003, new states with masses abovethe D¯D(∗) and B¯B(∗) thresholds were observed. A com-mon feature is the presence of a heavy quarkQ andanti-quark ¯Q pair in the decay products. As a conse-quence, the constituent-quark content of the decayingmeson has to include a heavy quark and a heavy anti-quark. However, the properties of many of these statesdid not match to those of any conventional quarkoniumstate. So, what are they?In addition to the conventionalq¯q mesons andqqqbaryons, models based on QCD predict hadrons withdifferentcombinationsofquarks qandgluons g,suchas:pentaquarks (q¯qqqq), tetraquarks (q¯qq¯q), six-quark H-dibaryons (q¯qq¯qq¯q), hydrids (q¯qg) and glueballs (ggg),see Sections 8.3 and 8.4. The existence of such “ex-otic” hadrons has been debated for several years with-outreachingageneralconsensus.Intheearly2000snewhadrons with unexpected features were observed, inparticular theD∗s0(2317)+ [2459] andχc1(3872) [2460]mesons and theΘ+ baryon [2461]. While the first twocandidates are still consistent with being conventionalc¯sand c¯cstates, the latter one is manifestly exotic witha minimal quark contentuddu¯s since it was observedin the nK+ and pK0S final states. However, while theexistence of theD∗s0(2317)+ and χc1(3872) mesons hasbeen extensively confirmed by many experiments, theevidence of theΘ+ baryon has faded away with time[2462]. The discovery of the χc1(3872) drew a lot ofattention due to the narrowness of the signal and theproximityofthemasstothe m(D0)+m( ¯D∗0) threshold.
Soon after many other charmonium-like and bottomo-nium-like states were observed. While it is still not pos-sible to rule out firmly a conventional nature for themajority of them, the observation of theZc(4430)+ me-son, an electrically charged charmonium-like state, andof theT+cc state, a meson containing two charm quarks,established definitively the existence of QCD exotics.
Many models have been proposed to explain the ex-otic nature of such a states:hadronic molecules [2463],whose constituents are color-singlet mesons bound byresidual nuclear forces,tetraquarks [2464], bound statesbetween a diquark and diantiquark,hadro-quarkonium[2465], a cloud of light quarks and gluons bound to aheavyQ¯Qcore state via van-der-Waals forces,thresholdeffects, enhancements caused by threshold cusps [2466]or rescattering processes [2467].

responding discovery papers without a consistent crite-rion as a consequence of their uncertain nature. Withthe number ofX,Y,Z states growing, the need of anadequate naming scheme emerged. The current namingscheme in Particle Data Group extends the conventionused for ordinary quarkonia by taking in account theisospin, spin and parity of the state [476]. The namesare not related to the internal structure of the statesgiven their nature is controversial. However, even thecurrent scheme presents some limitation for the mani-festlyexotic states anda new schemehasbeen proposedrecently [2468].
8.5.2 χc1(3872): The renaissance of the exotic spec-troscopyIn 2003, the Belle collaboration, while studying theB+ →J/ψπ−π+K+ decays,observedtwopeakingstruc-tures in theJ/ψπ−π+ mass projection (Fig.8.5.2): thewell known ψ(2S) meson and a new state, originallydubbed X(3872) [2460]. The new meson has been con-firmed by many experiments [2469–2475] and observedin prompt production inpp, p¯p, pPb [2476] and PbPb[2477] collisions as well as in B and Λ0b hadron de-cays [2478, 2479]. The invariant mass distribution ofthe dipion system is consistent with originating fromρ(770)0 →π+π− decays [2473, 2480]. Recently usinga larger dataset the presence of a sizeable contribu-tion of ω(782) →π+π− decays has been establishedas well [2481]. For a pure charmonium state, the decaysto J/ψω [2482, 2483] andJ/ψρ0 are isospin conservingand violating, respectively. Therefore the latter shouldbe strongly suppressed, in contrast to the measuredbranching ratios. Later on, further decay modes havebeen reported: D0 ¯D0π0 [2484], ¯D0D∗0 [2485], χc1π0[2486],J/ψγ [2487]and ψ(2S)γ.Thecurrentbranching-fraction measurements of the ψ(2S)γ radiative decay[2487–2490] are, however, not fully consistent and fur-ther studies are needed to solve the emerging tension.
Solving this puzzle will help to understand the nature ofthe X(3872) meson, given that the predicted branchingfractions span over a broad range of values dependingif theX(3872) state is aD∗0 ¯D0 molecule [2491, 2492]or a pure charmonium state [2493, 2494].
A study of the angular correlations among the finalstate particles fromX(3872) →J/ψπ+π− decays con-strained the possibleJPC assignments for theX(3872)to JPC = 1++ and 2−+ [2495]. The latter, disfavouredby the observation of the radiative decays, was defini-tively ruled out by the LHCb experiment [2496, 2497].
Once the quantum numbers JPC = 1 ++ have beenfirmly established, the name of X(3872) turned intoχc1(3872) according to the PDG naming scheme [476].
The identification of theX(3872) with the the23P1 c¯cstate is disfavoured by the large branching fraction ofX(3872) →J/ψρ0 and the large mass splitting withrespect to the23P2 state, identified withχc2(3930).
An intriguing feature of theχc1(3872) meson is theproximity of its mass to them(D∗0) + m(D0) thresh-old. This characteristic has led to speculate that theχc1(3872) is a molecular state [2498] where theD∗0 and¯D0 mesons are bound by residual nuclear forces, sim-ilarly to a proton and a neutron in the nucleus of thedeuterium. An important input for such an interpreta-tionisthebindingenergy Eb ≡mD0 +mD∗0 −mχc1(3872)which is still consistent with zero despite being mea-294 8 MESONSsured with a precision ofO(100) keV [2499, 2500]. Theanalyses also reported a measurement of the naturalwidth ΓBWχc1(3872 = (1 .39 ±0.24 ±0.10) MeV by using aBreit-Wigner lineshape for theχc1(3872) signal. How-ever, since the|Eb|<Γ BWχc1(3872), coupled channel effectsmight distort the lineshape. Indeed a Flatté-inspiredmodelreturneda significantlysmaller fullwidth athalf-maximum FWHM = (0 .22 ±0.070.06 ±0.110.13) MeV, highlight-ing the relevance of a physically well-motivated line-shape parameterization (see Section14.5).
The smallness of the binding energyEb = (0 .07 ±0.12) MeV [2499, 2500] implies a size of O(10) fm ina molecular scenario. The production of a large andweakly bound molecule is expected to be suppresseddue to the interactions with comoving hadrons pro-ducedintheunderlyingevent[ 2501].Theratioof χc1(3872)to ψ(2S) cross-sections for promptly produced parti-cles has been measured at LHC [2502] and has beenfound to decrease with multiplicity. However the slopewould seem not to agree with the expectations for amolecular state [2503]. In addition no enhancement ofthe χc1(3872) production has been observed in associ-ation to a pion [2504] as expected for a molecular stateproduced via the formation of a D∗ ¯D∗ pair at shortdistance followed by the rescattering of the charmedmesons intoχc1(3872)π[2505]. Finally, the relative pro-duction of χc1(3872) to ψ(2S) mesons as a functionof the transverse momentum and rapidity has showna mild (or null) dependence forχc1(3872) (or ψ(2S))mesons produced in promptpp collisions and from b-hadron decays, respectively [2473, 2506]. The CMS col-laboration has measured a large production rate of theχc1(3872) mesonsalsoatlargetransversemomentawhilea suppression is expected for hadronic molecules [2507],as measured for the deuteron [2508].
In order to reconcile the molecular picture to theproduction measurements, it has been suggested thatthe physicalχc1(3872) might be a quantum mechanicalmixture of aD∗0 ¯D0 molecule and the23P1 c¯c charmo-nium state [2509], where the production is dominatedby the charmonium component. Alternatively, an in-terpretation has been proposed where the χc1(3872)meson is a tightly bound diquark-diantiquark system[2464] with a size of a few fermis. In this scenario,isospin partner states are expected to exist. A searchfor charged X− states has been carried out by study-ing the decaysB0 →X−K+ and B− →X−K0S, whereX− →J/ψπ−π0 [2510, 2511]. No chargedX− has beenreported. Moreover noX− →D0D∗− signal has beenobserved in the D0 ¯D0π− mass spectrum [2512]. An-other firm prediction of the compact tetraquark modelsis that hidden charm states must form complete flavor-SU(3) multiplets with mass differences determined byFig. 8.5.2 Distribution of the mass differenceM(π+π−ℓ+ℓ−) − M(ℓ+ℓ−), where ℓ = e,µ and the in-variant mass of the dilepton system is within a range aroundthe J/ψ mass. The two signals correspond to theψ(2S) andχc1(3872) mesons, respectively [2460].
thequarkmassdifference ms−mu [2513].The χc1(3872)meson could belong to the same flavor multiplet of theX(4140) given both states haveJPC = 1++, where thetwo mesons are interpreted as[¯c¯q][cq] (q= u or d) and[¯c¯s][cs] bound states, respectively. As a consequence,a [cs][¯c¯q] state with mass(mX(4140) + mχc1(3872)/2 =4009 MeV should exist. Two exotic states, Zcs(3985)[2514]and Zcs(4000) [2515]havebeenobservedin D+s ¯D∗0and J/ψK+ mass spectra, respectively, with massesclose to 4000MeV, making them potential candidatesto complete the JPC = 1 ++ tetraquark nonet, whereC = +1 refers to the sign of charge conjugation of theneutral-non-strange members.
A C-odd partner of the χc1(3872) state, dubbed˜X(3872),isexpectedaswell[ 2464,2516].Severalexper-iments searched for a ˜X(3872) candidate in theJ/ψηand χc1γ mass spectra inB+ →J/ψη/χc1γK+ decaysbut no signal was reported [2517–2520], even thoughmanyothercharmoniumstateswereobserved.TheCOM-PASScollaborationsearchedformuo-productionofchar-monia in the processµ+N →µ+X0π±N′ with X0 →J/ψπ+π− where N denotes the target nucleon,N′ theunobserved recoil system andX0 an intermediate char-monium state [2521]. In addition to the observation ofthe ψ(2S) meson, evidence of a narrow structure, peak-ing at about 3872MeV in theJ/ψπ+π− spectrum, wasreported. While the measured mass and width pointedto an interpretation of the signal asχc1(3872) meson,the π+π− mass spectrum showed a rather flat distri-bution instead of the expectedρ0-like shape thus dis-agreeing significantly with previous experimental re-8.5 Heavy quark-antiquark sector: experiment 295sults. This surprising result led the authors to specu-late that the observed state might be theC-odd partner˜X(3872) decaying to theJ/ψf0(500) final state.
Assuming heavy flavor symmetry, a bottomoniumcounterpart Xb of the χc1(3872) meson is expected.
Searches for Xb, carried out by the CMS [2522] andATLAS [2523] collaborations by studying theΥπ+π−final state, have not been successful. This result doesnot rule out the existence of anXb state since, con-trary to theχc1(3872) case, theΥπ+π− decay mode isexpected to be suppressed due to the smaller isospinbreaking effect: the mass difference between the neu-tral and chargedB mesons is very small. Most likely,the Xb state would decay into theΥω and χbπ+π− fi-nal states. The former decay has been recently studiedby the Belle-II collaboration. NoXb meson has beenobserved [2524].
8.5.3 Zc(4430)+ and the charmonium-like statesThe observation of manifestly exotic candidates was aturning point in the discussion about the existence ofnon-conventional hadrons. Indeed, a peculiar character-istic of charmonium-like states is the possibility to ob-serve states with non-zero electrical charge and quarkcontent c¯cu¯d.
The first-ever candidate, theZc(4430)+ meson, wasobserved bythe Belle collaboration in theψ(2S)π+ pro-jection of ¯B0 →ψ(2S)K−π+ and B+ →ψ(2S)K0Sπ+decays[2525].The m2(Kπ+) versusm2(ψ(2S)π+) Dalitz-plot distributions show a continuous band (and a peakinthe m2(ψ(2S)π+) projection)togetherwithtwobandsin the m2(Kπ+) mass distributions corresponding tothe K∗(892) and K∗0/2(1430) resonances. After apply-ing a veto on theK∗ regions, a one-dimensional fit tothe ψ(2S)π+ projection returned the mass and width(Table8.5.1) of a signal that was interpreted as the firstcharmonium-like state with non-zero electrical charge(Fig. 8.5.3). Given that the decay modes have four de-grees of freedom, the claim of a new exotic state basedon the study of a one-dimensional projection receivedsome criticism. In addition, excluding regions in theKπ+ invariant mass does not imply that interferenceeffects are removed which could lead to peaking struc-tures in other projections.
A model-independent approach was pursued by theBaBar collaboration which investigated the extent towhichthereflectionsofmassandangulardistributionofstructuresinthe Kπ+ systemmightdescribetheassoci-ated ψ(2S)π+ mass distributions in¯B0 →ψ(2S)K−π+and B+ → ψ(2S)K0Sπ+ decays [2526].

The combinations of the firstN = 2Jmax+1 =7 terms reproduces adequately theψ(2S)π+ mass dis-tribution whereJmax = 3 is the maximum spin of theexcited K∗ resonances expected in theKπ+ spectrum.
This result provided a hint that an exotic contributionmay not be needed, but it cannot rule out the pres-ence of theZc(4430)+ meson either. Later on, the Bellecollaboration performed a fit to them2(Kπ+) versusm2(ψ(2S)π+) Dalitz-plot [2527] and finally a completefour-dimensional amplitude analysis [2528], both con-firming the observation of an exotic state. The latteranalysis quotes a natural width for theZc(4430)+ muchlarger than the one reported in the discovery paper (Ta-ble 8.5.1) which highlights the relevance of performingfull amplitude analyses to measure the physical param-eters.
The existence of theZc(4430)+ exotic state was de-bated for many years until the LHCb collaboration alsostudied the ¯B0 →ψ(2S)K−π+ decays [2529].

In addition, the resonant character of a chargedfour-quark state is demonstrated for the first time byrepresenting theZc(4430)+ amplitude as the combina-tion of independent complex amplitudes at six equidis-tant points in them2(ψ(2S)π+) spectrum. The result-ing Argand diagram, shown in Fig.8.5.4, is consistentwith a rapid change of theZc(4430)+ phase when itsmagnitude reaches the maximum, a behavior charac-teristic of a resonance. Finally, an analysis of the data,using the model-independent approach developed bythe BaBar collaboration, shows significant inconsisten-cies in the Zc(4430)+ region between the data and amodel introducing K∗ states with J ≤3 [2530]. Ev-idence of the Zc(4430)+ → J/ψπ+ is also reportedby an amplitude analysis of the¯B0 →J/ψK−π+ de-cays [2531]. After the discovery of theZc(4430)+ me-son, many further charged charmonium-like states havebeen reported (Table8.5.2), including candidates withstrangeness and isospin partners [2532, 2533].
8.5.4 The bottomonium-like Z+b statesFew years after the discovery of theZc(4430)+ meson,the Belle collaboration claimed the observation of twobottomonium-like states Zb(10610)+ and Zb(10650)+in the Υ(nS)π+ (n=1, 2, 3) and hb(mP)π+ (m =1,2) spectra by studying the exclusive processese+e− →Υ(nS)π+π− (n=1,2,3)and e+e− →hb(mP)π+π− (mTable 8.5.2Decay modes and quantum numbers of manifestlyexotic charmonium-like states.

Two narrow structures appear inthem(Υ(nS)π±) spectrum (e.g.Fig. 8.5.5). The analysesof the hb(mP)π± spectra returned compatible results.

Later on a six-dimensional amplitude analysis of theΥ(nS)π+π− (n = 1, 2, 3) three-body final states con-firmed the existence of the twoZ+b states and stronglyfavoredIG(JP) = 1 +(1+) quantum-numberassignmentsfor both of them [2545]. Finally the Zb(10610)+ andZb(10650)+ mesons have been observed in theB+ ¯B∗0and B∗+ ¯B∗0 mass spectrum, respectively [2546].

The two peaking structures are interpreted as theZb(10610)+ and Zb(10650)+ bottomonium-like states. [2544].
The large branching fractions of theB(∗) ¯B∗ decaymodes and the measured quantum numbers are consis-tent with the interpretation of the two states asB¯B∗and B∗ ¯B∗ loosely bound molecular hadrons. Howeverthe measured mass for theZb(10610)+ and Zb(10650)+are both above the nearby open-flavor thresholds. Thismight be the result of using Breit-Wigner functionsto parameterize the amplitudes of very near-thresholdstates. Indeed, when amplitudes consistent with unitar-ity and analyticity are used instead, lower masses aremeasured, typically below the thresholds [2547].
8.5.5 The B+c mesonsContrary to charmonium and bottomonium states, theB+c mesons can not annihilate into gluons and thusthese states are more stable. Indeed, apart from thegroundstatewhichdecaysweakly,alltheexcitedstates,with masses below the lowest strong decay B(∗)D(∗)thresholds, are predicted to have narrow widths [2548,2549].
Before the start of LHC, only the groundB+c statewasobserved[ 2550]viafewdecaysmodes: B+c →J/ψπ+and B+c →J/ψℓ+ν. The LHCb and CMS experimentshave observed 15 new decays modes and have largelyimproved the precision of theB+c mass [2551] and life-time [2552–2554]. The production of theB+c meson hasbeen observed in p¯p, pp as well as in PbPb collisions[2555], where the measurement of the nuclear modifica-tion factor hints that effects of the hot and dense nu-clear matter created in heavy ion collisions contributeto its production.

In 2014 the ATLAS collaboration reported the first ob-servation of an excitedB+c state decaying toB+c π+π−final state [2556]. Few years later the same mass spec-trum was investigated by other LHC experiments [2557,2558] and it turned out that the ATLAS structure wasvery likely the result of a superimposition of two nar-rower signals (Fig.8.5.6), interpreted as theBc(2S)+and B∗c(2S)+ states. The latter appears in the massspectrumasapartiallyreconstructeddecay B∗c(2S)+ →B∗+c π+π−, where the photon of theB∗+c →B+c γ re-action is not reconstructed. Since theB∗+c meson hasnot been observed yet, the mass of theB∗c(2S)+ statecan not be measured and it is not listed in the PDG.
In the next years the upgraded LHC experiments willprobe the largely unexplored spectrum of the excitedB+c mesons below and above theB(∗)D(∗) thresholdswith the intriguing possibility to observe exotic statesas for the other quarkonium systems [2559].
8.5.6 The doubly charmed Tcc(3875)+ stateAll the exotic mesons described so far are featured bya heavy quark-antiquark pairQ¯Q and a light quark-antiquark pair q¯q. The observation of several Q¯Qq¯qstate has revived the discussion on the existence of ofQQ¯q¯q states with two heavy quarks and two light an-tiquarks. In the limit of a large heavy-quark mass, thetwo heavy quarks QQ form a heavy point-like color-antitriplet object, that behaves like an antiquark, andthe corresponding four-quark state should be bound.
The argument that such a state should exist, if the massof the charm quark is enough, has been discussed ex-298 8 MESONS3.873.88 3.89 3.9 0102030405060703.8743.876 0510152025303540Yield/(500 keV /c2)LHCb9 fb−1+• DataT+cc →D0D0π+BackgroundTotalD∗+D0 thresholdD∗0D+ thresholdmD0D0π+[GeV /c2]mD0D0π+ [GeV /c2]Yield/(200 keV /c2)Fig. 8.5.7 Distribution of D0D0π+ mass where the contri-bution of the non-D0 background has been statistically sub-tracted.The D∗+D0 andD∗0D+ thresholdsareindicatedwiththe vertical dashed lines.

tensively, but a consensus was not reached. Even latticeQCD calculations had not provided a definite conclu-sion [2560]. The cc¯u¯d ground state, hereafter denotedas T+cc, is predicted with spin-parity quantum numbersJP = 1 + and isospin I = 0 . The only known hadronwith a similar quark content is theΞ++cc baryon [2561–2563], a bound state of twoc quarks and oneu quark.
Its measured mass [2564] implies that the mass of theT+cc is close to the sum of masses ofD0 and D∗+ mesons[1070].
The LHCb experiment reported the observation ofa narrow state in theD0D0π+ mass spectrum near theD∗+D0 mass threshold compatible with being a T+cctetraquark state [1071, 2512]. TheD0D0π+ final stateis reconstructed by selecting events with twoD0 mesonsand a positively charged pion, all produced at the sameproton-proton interaction point. BothD0 mesons arereconstructed in theD0 →K−π+ decay channel. Themass distribution of the selectedD0D0π+ candidatesis shown in Fig.8.5.7. A narrow peak near theD∗+D0mass threshold is clearly visible.
An extended unbinned maximum-likelihood fit tothe D0D0π+ mass spectrum is performed by modellingthe signal with a Breit-Wigner functionFBW. The mea-sured mass δm and the full width at half maximum(FWHM) of theT+cc state are reported in Table8.5.4,where the uncertainties are statistical. The mass pa-rameterδmisdefinedrelativetothe D∗+D0 massthresh-oldas δm≡m−mD∗+ −mD0 ,where mD∗+ andmD0 de-note the known masses of theD∗+ and D0 mesons.

A more advanced parameterization isneeded to probe the physical properties of the reso-nance. An unitarized Breit-Wigner profile FU is con-sidered as an alternative model for theTcc(3875)+ sig-nal, where the energy-dependent width accounts for theT+cc →D0D0π+, T+cc →D0D+π0 and T+cc →D0D+γdecays. The resulting mass, relative toD∗+D0 thresh-old, and the FWHM of the signal are shown in Ta-ble8.5.4andcomparedtotheresultsofthe FBW model.
The narrowness of the T+cc state varies substantiallyhighlighting the relevance of accounting for theD∗Dthresholds. Despite the difference in results, both mod-els can describe the data adequately given the massresolution of about 400keV/c2. TheTcc(3875)+ state isthe narrowest exotic state observed to date.

The peak in the D0D0π+ could be interpreted asthe I3 = 0 component of an isotriplet (ˆT0cc, ˆT+cc, ˆT+cc+)with cc¯u¯u, cc¯u¯dand cc¯d¯dquark content, respectively.

The discoveryof theTcc(3875)+ meson implies the existence of abb¯u¯dstate that should be stable against strong and electro-magnetic interactions: its mass is expected to fall belowthe B∗−B0 and B−B0 mass thresholds. The observa-tion of a long-lived exotic state will be an intriguinggoal for future experiments.
8.5.7 The fully charmed tetraquark X(6900)Many QCD-motivted phenomenological models [2570,2571]havepredictedtheexistenceofstatesconsistingoffour heavy quarksTQQ¯Q¯Q. In 2020 the LHCb collabora-tion reported the study of the invariant mass spectrumof the J/ψ pairs where both J/ψ mesons are recon-structed via the µ+µ− decay [2565]. As a result, thereconstruction efficiency is large due to the presence ofmuons only in the final state. A pair ofJ/ψ mesons canbe produced in proton-proton collisions at LHC via sin-gle (SPS) or double (DPS) parton scattering processes,where the twoJ/ψ are produced in a single or two sepa-rated interactions of gluons or quarks, respectively. TheSPS process includes both resonant production via in-termediate states, such asTc¯cc¯c, and nonresonant pro-duction.
The J/ψJ/ψ mass distribution (Fig.8.5.8) shows abroad structure just above the kinematic threshold anda narrower peak at about 6.9 GeV, dubbedX(6900).
An unusual dip also appears between them. The broadstructure can be modelled as a superimposition of twoBreit-Wigner structures or as an interference between aBreit-Wigner function and the background. The lattermodelsuccessestodescribealsothedipadequately.Thepresence of the X(6900) state is established in bothmodels, though the natural width is twice larger in thelatter.
Recently the CMS [2566] and ATLAS [2567] col-laborations have presented preliminary studies of theJ/ψJ/ψ spectrum (Fig.8.5.8). While theX(6900) stateis confirmed, there is no consensus on the fit model.
Common features are the presence of dips in the spec-trum and the need of interference terms to describeit properly. Interestingly the CMS collaboration alsoclaimed the observation and the evidence of two newstates X(6600) and X(7300), respectively. A hint of thelatter structure was also pointed out by the LHCb col-laboration.
Given no single light hadron can mediate the inter-action between charmonia to generate a loosely boundmolecule, theX(6900) meson seems likely to be a com-pacttetraquark[ 2572].TheLHCexperimentswillprofitof larger datasets in a near future which will help to in-vestigate further the resonant nature of the peaks andeventually to measure their spins and parities [2573] inthe J/ψJ/ψ and ψ(2S)J/ψ spectra.300 8 MESONSTetraquarks states containing only bottom quarks,Tbb¯b¯b, have been also searched for by the LHCb andCMS collaborations in theΥµ+µ− decay [2574, 2575]but no signal have been observed.
8.5.8 ConclusionsThe existence of exotic hadronic states with more thanminimal quark content (q¯q or qqq) was proposed sincethe birth of the quark model [17,18]. In the last decadessamples of quarkonia larger and larger have been ex-ploited to study their transition and production pro-cesses. New and fascinating exoticX,Y,Z states havebeen observed at a large number of facilities and in dif-ferent production processes: at tau-charm (BES exper-iment) andB factories (BaBar and Belle experiments),in hadroproduction at Fermilab Tevatron and the LargeHadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, in photon-gluon fu-sion at DESY, photoproduction at JLab, and in heavy-ion production and suppression at RHIC, NA60, andLHC. In the upcoming years an unprecedented amountof data will be available from the upgraded experi-ments CMS, ATLAS, LHCb, ALICE, Belle II and BE-SIII [1424, 2576–2580] and more data will come in fu-ture from Panda at FAIR and the Electron Ion Collider(EIC) [2581, 2582]. The measurements of the quan-tum numbers and classification of the exotic hadronsin SU(3) flavour multiplets will be an important stepto understand the nature of the observed exotic states.
In addition it will be important to identify observableswhich can discriminate between different models. Forinstance the measurement of the effective range hasbeen suggested as a physical quantity able to determineif the χc1(3872) is a compact tetraquark or a loosely-bound molecular state [2583].
8.6 Heavy quark-antiquark sector: theoryNora Brambilla8.6.1 IntroductionHeavy quarks have been instrumental in accessing thestrong interactions as they provide a mass scale mhwhich is bigger thanLQCD: at such scale perturbationtheory is valid and scale factorization is useful. Amongthe systems with heavy quarks, systems with two (ormore) heavy quarks are very special, being endowedwith a pattern of separated energy scales. Quarkoniumin particular, a bound state of a heavy quark and aheavyanti-quark,providesaspecialtooltostudystronginteractions.
The 1974 discovery of theJ/ψ [75, 76], the char-monium ground state, drastically changed and shapedthe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics: termedthe November revolution, it represented the confirma-tion of the quark model, the discovery of the charmquark,theconfirmationoftheGIMmechanism[ 78](themechanism through which flavor-changing neutral cur-rents are suppressed in loop diagrams), and the firstdiscovery of a quark of large mass moving nonrelativis-tically. It was also the confirmation of QCD in its mostpeculiar properties of high-energy asymptotic freedomand low-energy confinement [80]. The small width canbe explained by the fact thatJ/ψ is the lowestc¯c en-ergy level and can decay only via annihilation, whichmakes available in the process a large energy, of or-der of twice the mass of the charm quark (about 2GeV). The annihilation width is then proportional toα2s(2mc) which is small due to asymptotic freedom,since mc is bigger than ΛQCD. Confinement becomesalso manifest in the case of quarkonium, where thecolor-singlet static quark-antiquark interaction poten-tial can be written in terms of a Wilson loop (see e.g.
[2584, 2585]). Confinement emerges as an area law inthe Wilson loop [80] , cf. Fig. 8.6.1, and correspond-ingly a linear potential grows with the distance be-tween the quarks [2586] as V0 = lim T→∞(i/T) ln W,where W = Tr P exp {igs∮Γ0dzµAµ(z)}, see Fig.8.6.2and Section 6.1.
The energy scales involved in quarkonium span fromthe hard region, where an expansion in the couplingconstant is possible and precision studies may be done,to the low-energy region, dominated by confinementand the many manifestations of nonperturbative dy-namics. This property underlies its uniqueness and isthe reason for which quarkonium plays a crucial rolefor a number of problems at the frontier of our research,122rt=0t=Ty yx x1Fig. 8.6.1The static Wilson loop along the circuitΓ0: it con-tains the interaction of a static quark-antiquark pair created ata time t = 0 (respectively at space pointsy1 and y2) annihi-lated at a subsequent large time T (at space pointsx1 and x2)Initial and final states are made gauge invariant by the pres-ence of the Schwinger line.

8.6.2 Scales and Effective Field TheoriesThe multiscale nature of quarkonium has made a de-scriptionwithinQuantumFieldTheoryparticularlydif-ficult until the advent of non-relativistic effective fieldtheories (NREFTs), cf. Sec. 6.1. When in the eightiesof last century, theorists set up to investigate the struc-ture of the energy levels of charmonium and bottomo-nium, they noticed that it can be reproduced by using aSchrödinger equation with a static potential composedof an attractive Coulomb contribution (with the appro-priate SU(3) color factor for a singletQ¯Q) and a termlinear in the distance: the famous Cornell potential (seeSection 2.1 and Ref. [734, 2588]:V0(r) = −κr + σr+ const. (8.6.1)This was the quark model description with the poten-tial inspired by QCD. The parameterκ was identifiedwith 43 αs, corresponding to a one-gluon exchange thatshould dominate at small distances due to asymptoticfreedom. The string tension σ corresponds to a con-stant energy density related to confinement and gener-ates a potential growing with the interquark distancerat large distances. A fit to the states gaveκ= 0.52 andσ = 0 .182 GeV2. In order to describe the fine and hy-perfine characteristics of the spectrum, relativistic cor-rections to the static potential have been introducedto account for effects of orderv2, i.e.20% to 30% forthe charmonium and up to10% for the bottomoniumspectrum. They appear at the order1/m2h in the expan-sion, involving both spin dependent (spin-spin, tensorand spin-orbit couplings) and purely velocity depen-dent terms. They were derived in the eighties, eitherfrom the semirelativistic reduction of a Bethe–Salpeterequation [824] for the quark-antiquark Green functions(or, equivalently at this level, from the reduction of thequark-antiquark scattering amplitude with an effectiveexchange) or in some model description like the flux-tube model [2366], for a review see [2584, 2585, 2589].
The problem of these approaches is the lack of a pre-cise connection to QCD. Taking advantage of NREFTs,quarkonium can be described directly in QCD, and inthis way it becomes a probe of strong interactions.
The spectrum of quarkonium, see Fig. 8.1.1, clearlystates that it is a nonrelativistic system: the differencein the orbital energy levels is much smaller than thequark mass. Definingv as the heavy quark velocity inthe rest frame of the meson in units ofc(with v2 ∼0.1for the b¯b, v2 ∼ 0.3 for c¯c systems) the energy lev-els scales like mhv2, while fine and hyperfine separa-tions scale like mhv4. This is the same scaling as forthe hydrogen atom (identifyingv with the fine struc-ture constant αem). This scaling is the signature of anonrelativistic system. Being nonrelativistic, quarkoniaare characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales: themass mh of the heavy quark (hard scale), the typicalrelative momentump∼mhv (in the meson rest frame)corresponding to the inverse Bohr radiusr ∼1/(mhv)(soft scale), and the typical binding energyE ∼mhv2(ultrasoft scale). Of course, for quarkonium there is an-other scale that can never be switched off in QCD, i.e.
ΛQCD, the scale at which nonperturbative effects be-come dominant. A similar pattern of scales emerge inthe case of baryons composed of two or three heavyquarks [1411, 1412] and for the just discovered stateX(6900) madebytwocharmandtwoanticharmquarks.
Thepatternofnonrelativisticscalesmakesallthediffer-ence between heavy quarkonia and heavy-light mesons,which are characterized by just two scales: mh andΛQCD.
Thecorrectzero-orderproblemisthustheSchrödin-ger equation with potentials. These should, however, bedefined and calculated directly in QCD, and nonpoten-302 8 MESONStial corrections that should be accounted for. As ex-plained in Sec. 6.1 using the EFT method to integrateout in QCD (in the sector with one heavy quark andone heavy antiquark) the hard scalemh and the softscale mhv, give origin to the NREFT called pNRQCD(potential Nonrelativistic QCD) [1422,1450,1452]. ThepNRQCDdescriptiondirectlyaddressestheboundstatedynamics,implementstheSchrödingerequationaszero-orderproblem,properlydefinesthepotentialsasmatch-ing coefficients, and allows to systematically calculaterelativistic and retardation corrections. Each correctionhas a size determined by the power counting invand inαs. The EFT allows us to make model-independent pre-dictions and we can use the power counting to attachan error to the theoretical predictions.
When mv≫ΛQCD, we speak about weakly-coupledpNRQCD because the soft scale is perturbative and thepotentialscanbecalculatedinperturbationtheory.Thelowest levels of quarkonium, likeJ/ψ,Υ(1S),Υ(2S) ... ,may be described by weakly coupled pNRQCD, whilethe radii of the excited states are larger and presumablyneed to be described by strongly coupled pNRQCD.
All this is valid for states away from the strong-decaythreshold, i.e. the threshold for a decay into two heavy-light hadrons. In the first case the dynamical degreesof freedom areQ¯Q pairs in color singlet or color octetconfiguration and ultrasoft gluons, in the second casejust Q¯Q pairs in color singlet. The details of the twotheories have been presented in Section 6.1. The non-perturbative physics in pNRQCD is encoded in a fewlow-energy correlators that depend only on the gluonsand are gauge invariant: these are objects in princi-ple ideal for lattice calculations. Strongly coupled pN-RQCD allows us to obtain a definition of the potentialsthat are given in terms of Wilson loops also in gen-eralized form (i.e. with the insertion of chromoelectricand chromomagnetic field in the static loop). The staticpotential is given by the static Wilson loop describedbefore that was calculated on the lattice since the in-ception of QCD [80, 326, 1528, 2586, 2590], up to thepresent state of the art that includes four dynamicalquarks in the calculation, see Fig.8.6.2. Some of thesepotentials have been obtained before the advent of theEFT in the so-called Wilson-loop approach [80, 768,1461, 1462, 2591, 2592], but they were missing the con-tribution of the hard scale. Moreover in the EFT, new(spin-independent) contributions appear at the order1/mh and at the order1/m2h [1516, 1517]. The resultsof strongly coupled pNRQCD – which are valid in theregime in whichmhvis of orderΛQCD and where strongdecay thresholds are far away – justify the success of thequark model from the QCD perspective. In fact in thisregime the only degree of freedom is theQ¯Q singlet,the dynamics is controlled by the Schrödinger equationand ultrasoft corrections are carried only by pions. Thepotentials, however, are calculated from QCD and theyhave a structure that is different from what one gets inmodels, especially for terms related to momentum de-pendent contributions. This EFT description allows formodifications that could be used to describeX,Y,Z ex-otics and (combining with finite temperature QCD andopen quantum system) the nonequilibrium evolution ofquarkonium in medium, as it will summarized later.
8.6.3 The quarkonium potential and confinementThe lattice QCD evaluation of the static Wilson loopclearly displays an area law which is the sign for con-finement. Still, it is relevant to investigate the natureof the confinement mechanism. Quarkonium is a goldentool for this aim. Stron/-gly-coupled pNRQCD realizesa scale factorization encoding the low-energy physics inthe Wilson loop and its generalized versions, i.e. Wil-son loops with insertions of chromoelectric and chro-momagnetic fields. All the potentials, static ones andspin and velocity-dependent ones, are given in terms ofthese gauge invariant nonperturbative objects that nolonger depend on the heavy quark degrees of freedomand on the quark flavor. This turns out to be a system-atic method to study the QCD confinement propertiesand put them directly in relation to the quarkoniumphenomenology.
The area law emerging in the static Wilson loop atlarge distance corresponds to the formation of a chro-molectric flux tube between the quark and the anti-quark that sweeps the area of the loop: this has been di-rectly observed on the lattice, see Fig.8.6.3. The effectsoriginates from the nonperturbative QCD vacuum thatcan be imagined as a disordered medium with whirl-poolsofcolorondifferentscales,thusdenselypopulatedby fluctuating fields whose amplitude is so large thatthey cannot be described by perturbation theory [404].
A QCD vacuum model can be established by makingan assumption on the behavior of the Wilson loop inthe low energy. The relativistic corrections that involveinsertions of gluonic fields in the Wilson loop follow viafunctional derivative with respect to the quark path see[2584, 2592]. One may notice that the part proportionalto the square of the angular momentum in the velocitydependent potential at order1/m2h takes into accountthe energy and the angular momentum of the flux tube,which is something that could not be obtained e.g. inany Bethe Salpeter approach with a confining inter-action represented by a scalar convolution kernel. Theaction density or the energy density structure betweenthe static quark and the static antiquark is currently8.6 Heavy quark-antiquark sector: theory 303Fig. 8.6.3The origin of the linear potential between the staticquark and antiquark may be traced back to a flux tube: a stringof gluon energy between the quark pair. Here we present thehystorical picture of the action density distribution between astatic quark antiquark couple in SU(2) at a physical distanceof 1.2 fm, from [2606].
studied both in the lowest energy configuration as wellas in the hybrid configurations with excited glue [2593–2595]. The mechanism underlying confinement and fluxtube formation has been investigated since long on thelattice [397] using Wilson loops and the ’t Hooft abelianprojection, to identify the roles of magnetic monopoles[2596,2597] and center vortices [403], see e.g. the review[1425].
Inthecontinuum,severalmodelsoflow-energyQCDhave been introduced to explain the flux-tube forma-tion. The models vary from the dual Meissner effect anda dual-abelian Higgs-model picture, from dual QCD[2598] to the stochastic vacuum [2599], to the flux tubemodel [2366] and an effective low energy string descrip-tion. Each of these models can be used to obtain ana-lyticestimates ofthe behaviorof thegeneralized Wilsonloops for large distance, which in turn give the staticpotential and the relativistic corrections as function ofr, see e.g. [1531, 2600–2603]. Similar nonperturbativeconfigurations leading to confinement can be studiedanalyzing the Wilson loop in case of baryons with threeor two heavy quarks [2604, 2605].
8.6.4 States below threshold:quarkoniumOn the basis of EFTs and lattice calculations we havereached today a comprehensive understanding of thepropertiesofquarkoniumbelowthestrongdecaythresh-old.
Spectra, transition and decaysThe power counting of the EFT allows us to attachan error to each prediction. For states with a small ra-dius one can use weakly-coupled pNRQCD with poten-tials calculated at high order in perturbation theory(see Sec. 6.1) and retardation effects carried by localor non-local condensates. For states with larger radii,the potentials obtained in strongly-coupled pNRQCD(see Sec. 6.1) have been calculated on the lattice [769,1526, 1528, 2607–2609], and the full quarkonium phe-nomenology may be obtained using such potentials inthe Schrödinger equation. The imaginary parts of thepotentials control the decays.
On the other hand, direct lattice calculations ofquarkonium properties along the years have reachedrealistic values for the dynamical quark flavors, solidcontinuum limits and have been extended to the ex-cited states, reaching a comprehensive and precise de-scription [1434, 2610–2614]. Electromagnetic M1 andE1 transitions have been calculated in pNRQCD, seee.g. [1511–1514]. There are so many results that it isimpossible to discuss all of them here and we refer tosome reviews [1422, 1424, 1425, 1478, 2576].
Summarizing: today we understand in a precise way,on the basis of QCD, most of the properties of thequarkonium states lying below the strong decay thresh-old. This has a great impact for the physics of quarko-nium, as we explain with examples in the next para-graph.
Precise determination of SM parametersIn the regime in which the soft scale is perturbative,pNRQCD enables precise and systematic higher ordercalculations of bound states allowing us to extract pre-cisely standard-model parameters like the quark massesand αs. For example, it has been possible to extract aprecise value ofαs at rather low energy by comparinga short-distance lattice calculation with 2+1 flavors ofthe static energy and a next-to-next-to-next leading or-der (NNNLO,α4s) perturbative pNRQCD calculation ofthe same quantity, including also ultrasoft logs resum-mation. Whenαs is extrapolated to the mass of the Z,αs(MZ) = 0 .11660+0.00110−0.00056 is obtained. This is a com-petitive extraction made at a pretty high order of theperturbative expansion [2615, 2616]. This method ofαsextraction is now used by several groups, see e.g. [2617,2618]. The QCD static force, defined in terms of a sin-gle chromolectric insertion in the Wilson loop could beused as well to the same scope [2619, 2620].
In the same way precise values of the bottom andcharm masses can be extracted from measurements ofthe masses of the lowest states and by comparing themto the formula for the energies in pNRQCD at NNNLO.
The renormalon ambiguity between the mass and thestatic potential cancels and a pretty good determina-tionispossible,seee.g.[ 1478,1487,1497]andreferencestherein. Similar methods [1477, 1497] can be used to304 8 MESONSdescribe the top anti-top S-wave pair-production crosssectionnearthresholdin e+e− annihilationandtostudythepossibleachievableaccuracyoftop-quarkmassmea-surement expected at a future linear collider. A precisedetermination of the top quark mass is very importantfor precision tests of the SM, and also due to its crucialrole in the vacuum stability of the SM at a very highenergy scale. Hence, progress in our understanding ofheavy quarkonia leads to an access to key aspects of theSM.
8.6.5 ProductionProduction of heavy quarkonium has been extensivelystudied along the years at the Tevatron collider at Fer-milab,atHeraatDESY,atBfactoriesandinparticularat the LHC where quarkonium production with highstatistics at unprecedented values of pT is measured[1424, 1425, 1437, 1438, 2576–2578]. This is a complexproblem encompassing many physical scales still notfully understood, and it can be used to test and extendour understanding of factorization theorems, which arethe foundation for all the perturbative calculations inQCD. New theoretical concepts that have been devel-oped here, e.g. arising from kinematic enhancementsand from large endpoint logarithms, could have widerapplicability in the calculation of high-energy cross sec-tions. Quarkonium production is also relevant to BSM,ascertainquarkoniumproductionprocessescanbeusedto measure Higgs couplings.
The standard method for calculating quarkoniumproductionratesistheNRQCD[ 1436](seeSec.6.1)fac-torization approach, where production rates are expres-sed as perturbatively calculable partonic cross sectionsmultipliedbynonperturbativeconstantscalledNRQCDlong-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) which are uni-versal. The NRQCD factorization approach is a con-jecture that has not been proven to all orders inαs.
Another important theoretical development is the next-to-leading-power (NLP) fragmentation approach [1277,2023], in which quarkonium production rates are ex-pressed as perturbatively calculable partonic cross sec-tions convolved with fragmentation functions, up tocorrections suppressed by a factor m4h/p4T. The NLPfragmentationapproachbecomesmorepredictiveifNR-QCD factorization is used to express the fragmentationfunctions in terms of NRQCD matrix elements. Thisorganizes the NRQCD factorization expression for thecross section according to powers ofm2h/p2T, which sim-plifies the calculation of higher-order corrections andthe resummation of large logarithms. NRQCD factor-ization predictions have now been computed at NLO inαs for many production processes.
The NRQCD approach has brought a great progressinto the field even though not all experimental dataare understood coherently, and the extraction of theLDMEs remains a complex enterprise [2621–2627]. Re-cently, it has been possible to factorize the quarkoniumproduction-cross sections at lower energy in pNRQCD[1533–1535],rewritingtheoctetNRQCDLDMEs,whichare the nonperturbative unknowns, in terms of prod-ucts of wave functions and gauge invariant low energycorrelators depending only on the glue and not the onflavor quantum numbers. This allows to reduce by halfthe number of LDMEs, opens up the possibility of theirlattice evaluation and may lead to further progress ofthe field.
8.6.6 Nonequilibrium evolution in mediumThe properties of production and absorption of quarko-nium in a nuclear and hot medium are crucial inputsfor the study of QCD at high density and temperature(see Sec.7), reaching out to cosmology.
Heavy ions experiments at the LHC at CERN andat the RHIC at BNL aim at producing the Quark GluonPlasma (QGP): heavy quarks are good probes of thishot QCD medium. They are produced at the begin-ning of the collision and remain up to the end. As wediscussed, quarkonia are special hard probes as theyare multi-scale systems. In the medium besides the en-ergy scales of quarkonium, also the thermal scales ofthe QGP have to be considered (cf Sec. 6.5): the scaleπT related to the temperature, the Debye massmD ∼gT, with αs = g2/4π, related to the (chromo) electricscreening and the scale g2T related to the (chromo)magnetic screening. In a weakly-coupled plasma, thescales are separated and hierarchically ordered, in astrongly coupled plasma,mD ∼T. To calculate QCDat finiteT in real time, Hard Thermal Loop EFT canbe used to integrate out the temperature scale. Heavyquarkonium dissociation has been proposed a long timeago as a clear probe of QGP formation through themeasurement of the dilepton decay-rate [2112]. The dis-sociation was related to the screening of the quark-antiquark interaction due to the Debye mass and itwas suggested that dissociation would manifest itself inan exponential screening termexp(−mDr) in the staticpotential. One of the key quantities measured in experi-mentsisthenuclearmodificationfactor RAA,ameasureforthedifferenceofquarkoniumproductioninppandinnucleus-nucleus collisions. Since higher excited quarko-nium states have larger radii, the expectation was that,as the temperature increases, quarkonium would disso-ciate first for the higher-mass and then for lower-massstates giving origin to sequential melting [2112].8.6 Heavy quark-antiquark sector: theory 305Inthelastdecades,usingpNRQCDatfiniteT[ 1552,2119], it has been possible to actually define and cal-culate the Q¯Q potential in medium. In perturbativecalculations it was found that the thermal part of thestatic potential has a real part (roughly described bythe free energy) and an imaginary part. The imagi-nary part comes from two effects: the Landau damping[1552, 1553, 2113], an effect existing also in QED, andthe singlet to octet transition, existing only in QCD[1552]. Which one dominates depends on the ratio be-tween mD and E. In the EFT one could show that theimaginary part of the potential related to the Landaudamping comes from inelastic parton scattering [1556]and the singlet to octet transition from gluon dissocia-tion[1555].Theexistenceoftheimaginarypart,firstre-alized in Ref. [2113], changed our paradigm for quarko-nium suppression: it has become clear that the statedissociates well before the conventional screening be-comes active [1553, 2113]. A similar pattern emergesin lattice nonperturbative calculations of the potential[2628, 2629].
Sofar,wehavediscussedanequilibriumdescription.
However, the evolution of quarkonium in the QGP is anout-of-equilibrium process in which many effects enter:the hydrodynamical evolution of the plasma and theproduction, dissociation and regeneration of quarko-nium in the medium, to quote the most prominent ones.
It is necessary therefore to introduce an appropriateframeworktodescribethereal-timenonequilibriumevo-lution. Recently, using the formalism of open quantumsystem(seeSec.6.6)andpNRQCD,ithasbeenpossibleto describe the nonequilibrium evolution of bottomo-nium inside a strongly coupled QGP, in a way that in-corporates the quantum effects, conserves the numberof heavy quarks and considers both color singlet andcolor octet quarkonium degrees of freedom as well astheir recombination [1559, 1560]. The results not onlydescribe well theRAAs measured at LHC [1562, 2110](see also [2118, 2630]), but they allow also to establisha connection with QCD, since the quarkonium evolu-tion depends only on two transport coefficients givenin terms of QCD gluonic correlators characterizing theQGP [1559, 1560]. For a review of open quantum sys-tem approaches for quarkonium, see [1561, 2631].
8.6.7 States at and above threshold: X,Y,Z Ex-otics: introAs explained in Sec. 8.5, the spectroscopy of charmo-nium and bottomonium states at or above the open-heavy-flavor thresholds have reserved us several sur-prises. Experiments ate+e− and hadron colliders havediscovered many new, unexpected states in the lastdecades, cf. Sec 8.5 and Fig.8.5.1. Many of these statesare surprisingly narrow, and some have electric charge.
The observations of these charged quarkonium statesare the first definitive discoveries of manifestly exotichadrons. These results challenge our understanding ofthe QCD spectrum. TheX,Y,Z offer us a unique op-portunity to investigate the dynamical properties ofstrongly correlated systems in QCD.
As mentioned in Sec. 8.5, These states have beentermed X,Y,Z in the discovery publications, withoutanyspecialcriterion.Meanwhile,theParticleDataGroup(PDG) has proposed a new naming scheme [2632], thatextendstheschemeusedforordinaryquarkonia,inwhichthe new names carry information on theJPC quantumnumbers, see [1388] for more details. Since the situationis still in evolution we will stick toX,Y,Z names. Thefield is in enormous and very fast development both ex-perimentally and theoretically, with a continuous fluxof new papers: we refer to reviews to account for thisdevelopment[1388,1424,2576,2633–2638].The X,Y,Zstates offer us unique possibilities for the investigationof the dynamical properties of strongly correlated sys-tems: we should develop the tools to gain a solid inter-pretation from the underlying field theory, QCD. Thisis a very significant problem with trade off to otherfields featuring strong correlations and pretty interest-ing connections to heavy ion physics, as propagation ofthese states in medium may help us to scrutinize theirstructure and composition.
8.6.8 X,Y,Z models and degrees of freedomSince the X(3872) discovery in 2003, a wealth of the-oretical papers appeared to investigate the character-istics of the exotics. Most papers are based on mod-els, which involve a choice of some dominant degrees offreedom and an assumption on their interaction hamil-tonian. In the case of states particularly close to theirheavy-light threshold, with a very small binding energyand a large scattering length, a more universal picturebased on an effective-field-theory molecular descriptionhas been put forward [2638–2642] and along the yearsit has been refined arriving at detailed calculations ofthe line shapes and the production properties.
A priori the simplest system consisting of only twoquarksandtwoantiquarks(genericallycalledtetraquarks)isalreadyacomplicatedobjectanditisunclearwhetheror not any kind of clustering occurs in it. To simplifythe problem, models focus on certain substructures andinvestigate their implications: in hadroquarkonia theheavy quark and antiquark form a compact core sur-rounded by a light-quark cloud; in compact tetraquarksthe relevant degrees of freedom are compact diquarks306 8 MESONSand antidiquarks; in the molecular picture two colorsinglet mesons are interacting at some typical distance:we have no chance here to illustrate all these mod-els and we refer to some recent reviews [1388, 2634,2636, 2638]. Discussions about exotics therefore oftenconcentrate on the “pictures” of the states, for exam-ple the tetraquark interpretation against the molecularone (of which both several different realizations exist).
However, as a matter of fact, all the light degrees offreedom (light quarks, glue, in different configurations)should be there in QCD close or above the strong decaythreshold: it is a result of the strong dynamics whichone sets in, and when, and which configuration domi-nates in a given regime.
Even in an ordinary quarkonium, which has a dom-inant Q¯Q, subleading contributions of the Fock spacemay contribute, which have additional quark-antiquarkpairs and active gluons. However, in the most inter-esting region, close or above the strong decay thresh-old, where theX,Y,Z have been discovered, the situa-tion is more complicated: there is no mass gap betweenquarkonium and the creation of a pair of heavy-lightmesons, nor to gluon excitations, therefore many addi-tional states appear and are dynamical degrees of free-dom to be considered [2633]. Still,mh is a large scale,and a scale factorization is applicable so that nonrela-tivistic QCD is still valid. There is still another scaleseparation that can be used to introduce a descriptionof the bound state similar to what is done in pNRQCD,in which the zero order problem is the Schrödingerequation. Let us consider bound states of two nonrela-tivistic particles and some light-quark degrees of free-dom, e.g. molecules in QED or quarkonium hybrids(Q¯Qg states) or tetraquarks (Q¯Qq¯q states) in QCD:electrons, gluon fields or light quarks fields change adi-abatically in the presence of heavy quarks or nuclei. Inthis situation the interaction between the heavy quarksor the one between nuclei due to the electron cloudmay be described at leading order of a nonrelativisticexpansion by an effective static energy (or potential)Eκ between the static sources whereκ labels differentexcitations of the light degrees of freedom. A plethoraof states can be built on each of the static energiesEκ by solving the corresponding Schrödinger equation,see Fig. 8.6.4 and 8.6.5. Based on this scale separa-tion one may describe hybrids and tetraquarks using aBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) description, similarly to whatis done in molecular systems. On the basis of this, theQCD static energies in presence of a static quark anda static antiquark can be classified according to repre-sentations of the symmetry groupD∞ h, typical of di-atomic molecules, and labeled byΛση (see Fig.8.6.6): Λis the rotational quantum number|⃗ˆr·⃗K|= 0 ,1,2,... ,H+2-like molecule spectrumIn H+2-like molecules excitations of the electronic cloud are separated from each otherby a gap of order mα2, while vibrational modes of the nucleus have an energy of ordermα2√m/M , which is much smaller than mα2; m = mass of e , M = mass of nucleus.

The QCD static energies,EΓ in Fig.8.6.7, havebeen calculated on the lattice in NRQCD more than 20years ago [2643], Γ representing a choice forΛση or inshort for the collective quantum numberκ. These lat-tice calculations uses Wilson loops with initial and finalstates encoding the given quantum numbers, to selecta given symmetry. The Born Oppenheimer approxima-tion idea has been first exploited in phenomenologicalapplications by [1546, 1548]. This picture may be madeprecise inside QCD using NREFTs and has the possi-bility to subdue many different models and pictures. Inthe next section the content of BOEFT and its impli-cations will be presented.
8.6.9 BO Effective Field TheoryStarting from pNRQED/pNRQCD the BO approxima-tion can be made rigorous and cast into a suitable EFTcalled Born-Oppenheimer EFT (BOEFT) [1388, 1421,1547, 1549, 2644–2646] which exploits the hierarchy ofscales ΛQCD ≫mhv2.
InRef.[ 1549]theBOEFTthatdescribeshybridshasbeen obtained. In particular, the static potentials and aset of coupled Schrödinger equations were derived andsolved to produce the hybrids multiplets for the twofirst static energies Σ−u and Πu. Such static energiesare degenerated at short distance where the cylindri-cal symmetry gets subdue to aO(3) symmetry and arethen labelled by the quantum number of a gluonic oper-8.6 Heavy quark-antiquark sector: theory 307ator 1+− called a gluelump. The hybrid static energiesare described by a repulsive octet potential plus thegluelump mass in the short distance limit. TheO(3)symmetry is broken at orderr2 of the multipole expan-sion. In the long distance regime the static energies dis-play a behavior linear inr, cf. Fig.8.6.7. The gluelumpcorrelator can be calculated on the lattice to determinethe gluelump mass. It depends on the scheme used (thescheme dependence cancels against the analogous de-pendence in the quark mass and in the octet static po-tential) but it is of the order of 800 MeV. The hybridmultiplets Hi are constructed from the solution of theSchrödinger equations in correspondence to theirJPCquantum numbers. The coupling between the differentSchrödinger equations is induced by a non-adiabaticterm, known in the Born-Oppenheimer description ofdiatomic molecules, induced by the non-commutationbetween the kinetic term and a projector of the cylin-drical symmetry in the BOEFT lagrangian. The degen-eracy of the static energies at small distance inducesa phenomenon calledΛ doubling, removing the degen-eration between multiplets of opposite parity. This phe-nomenonisknowninmolecularphysicsbutwithsmallersize. This and the structure of the multiplets differ fromwhat is obtained in models for the hybrids, cf. [1549].
TheBOEFThybridmultipletscanbecomparedtoneu-tral exotic states measured in the bottomonium andcharmonium sector [1388]: there are many experimentalcandidates and to make clear identifications one shouldstudy also the decay and production properties in thesame framework.
The picture can be generalized to tetraquarks byconsidering static energies classified by theD∞ quan-tum numbers and isospin quantum numbers, extractedfromlatticeevaluationofthestaticenergiesofsystemofa heavy quark, a heavy antiquark and two light quarks[1421].

Exotic spin structures, decaysIn Refs. [2645, 2646] the spin-dependent potential ofhybrids has been obtained at order1/mh and 1/m2h inthe quark mass expansion. The potential turned out tobe rather different from the spin potential known fromstandard quarkonium. In fact, a1/mh contribution ap-pears due to the coupling of the angular momentumof the gluonic excitation (which is not suppressed inmh) with the total spin of the heavy-quark-antiquarkpair. Among the1/m2h operators are the standard spin-orbit, total spin squared, and tensor spin operators re-spectively, which appear for standard quarkonia. Butnow three novel operators appear in addition. So inter-estingly and differently from the quarkonium case, thehybrid potential gets a first contribution already at or-der Λ2QCD/m. Hence, spin splittings are remarkably lesssuppressed in heavy quarkonium hybrids than in heavyquarkonia: this will have a notable impact on the phe-nomenology of exotics. The nonperturbative low-energycorrelators appearing in the factorization can be ex-tracted by fixing them using lattice data on the massesof charmonium hybrids [2613], Then, all bottomonium-hybrid spin-multiplets (more difficult to evaluate on thelattice [1434]) can be predicted. The BOEFT is there-fore able to predict all spin hybrid multiplets, includingtheir decays and transitions [1388].
Avoided Level CrossingIn the BOEFT the information is carried by the QCDstatic energies and a few purely gluonic low-energy cor-relators.

scription has been put forward recently [2648, 2649] in-spired by lattice calculation in which the avoided-level-crossing-effect is exploited to construct a set of coupledSchrödinger equations and a procedure for the calcu-lation of open-flavor meson-meson scattering cross sec-tions from diabatic potentials. In this framework, theX(3872) naturally emerges [2648]. Such a descriptioncan be carried over to BOEFT.

In the case of tetraquarks, a necessary input of thetheory is the calculation on the lattice of the gener-alized Wilson loops with appropriate symmetry andlight quark operators. Note that besides the quantumnumber κ also the isospin quantum numbersI = 0 ,1have to be considered. It is interesting to note that theBOEFT approach reconciles the different pictures ofexotics based on tetraquarks, molecules, hadroquarko-nium…In fact in the plot of the static energy as a func-tion of r for a state withQ¯Qq¯q or Q¯Qg we will havedifferent regions: for short distance a hadroquarkoniumpicturewouldemerge,thenatetraquark(orhybrid)oneand, when passing the heavy-light mesons line, avoided-cross-level effects should be taken into account and amolecular picture would emerge. QCD would then dic-tate, through the lattice correlators and the BOEFTcharacteristicsandpowercounting,whichstructurepre-vails and in which precise way. In addition productionand suppression in medium may be described in thesame approach [1534, 2109].
8.6.10 X,Y,Z LatticeLattice QCD plays a key role for the description of ex-otics [2612, 2650]. For what concerns BOEFT, nonper-turbative input from the lattice is needed in the formof static energies, gluelumps correlators, insertions ofchromoelectric fields on hybrids states, for a full list see[2633]. Lattice groups have started to calculate some ofthese crucial quantities [2651–2654].
Direct lattice calculations of the spectrum and prop-erties of exotic states at and above thresholds are ex-tremely challenging. These states are resonances in thepertinent multi-hadron channels and to obtain theirproperties, scattering amplitudes in the relevant kine-matic range should be calculated on the lattice. Theapproach is based on Lüscher’s work. Later generaliza-tions give access to scattering amplitudes of two-hadronelastic channels, of multiple coupled two-hadron inelas-tic channels, and of three-hadron channels. While theLüscher method for a single two-hadron elastic channelprovides a straightforward mapping between scatteringamplitudes and finite-volume energies, this connectionis lost for the multi-channel case, and a parameteriza-tion of the amplitude is needed. Abundant and preciseenergy eigenvalues in a given kinematic range shouldbe obtained to constrain these multi-parameter forms,with solid systematic uncertainties. As the calculationsmove toward physical values of the light-quark masses,the multi-hadron thresholds move towards lower ener-gies and the number of kinematically allowed hadronicchannels that need to be included in the determinationof scattering amplitudes increases, making everythingmore challenging. Still interesting information aboutsome exotics mesons could be obtained in these directlattice calculations, see e.g. [549, 2655].
8.6.11 SummaryQuarkonium has been at the origin of QCD. It has beena long way to arrive at describing quarkonium withinQCD. It has payed off, making quarkonium a specialprobe of strong interactions at zero and at finite tem-perature. We are now in the process to attack the nextfrontier, i.e. to develop a coherent, field-theory-baseddescription of exotic quarkonium states. Notice, that ifnew physics involves nonrelativistic bound states, then
